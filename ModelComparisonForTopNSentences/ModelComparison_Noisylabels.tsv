en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	Recently  Rolnick et al (2017) have shown for classification that deep neural networks come with natural robustness to label noise following a particular random distribution.No modification of the network or the training procedure is required to achieve this robustness.Following this insight  our framework SELF relies on this natural robustness to kickstart the self-ensemble filtering process to extend the robust behavior to more challenging scenarios.	0.7720158073411311
en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	They use the entire label set to compute the loss and severely lack a mechanism to identify and filter out the erroneous labels from the labels set. In this paper  we propose a self-ensemble label filtering (SELF) framework that identifies potentially noisy labels during training and keeps the network from receiving supervision from the filtered noisy labels.This allows DNNs to gradually focus on learning from undoubtedly correct samples even with an extreme level of noise in the labels (e.g.  80% noise ratio) and leads to improved performance as the supervision become less noisy.	0.7737522255576442
en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	Note that this is different from just a mere combination of semi-supervised techniques with a noisy label filtering method. We call our approach self-ensemble label filtering (SELF) - that establishes model ensemble learning as a backbone to form a solid consensus of the self-ensemble predictions to filter out the noisy labels progressively.Our framework allows to compute supervised loss on cleaner subsets rather than the entire noisy labeled data as in previous works.	0.7740820399866839
en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	Typical robust learning approaches lead to significant accuracy losses at 40% noise  while SELF still retains high performance.Further  note that SELF allows the network’s performance to remain consistent across the different underlying architectures. 4.2.4 ABLATION STUDY Tab.	0.7835725122511918
en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	This result indicates that their proposed frameworks are not always compatible with semi-supervised losses.

en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	Employing semi-supervised learning can even counteract the noisy labels (Laine & Aila  2016; Luo et al  2018).However  the decision which labels are noisy and which are not is decisive for learning robust models.Otherwise  unfiltered noisy labels still inﬂuence the (supervised) loss and affect the task performance as in these previous works.	0.7881157957666459
en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	Although the detection of wrong labels is sometimes easy  finding their correct hidden label might be extremely challenging in case of having many classes.If the noise is sufficiently random  the set of correct labels will be representative to achieve high model performance.Further  in our framework  the label filtering is performed on the original label set L0 from iteration 0.	0.7883185245616929
en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	It further leverages the entire dataset  including the filtered out erroneous samples in the unsupervised loss.To best of our knowledge  we are the first to identify and propose self-ensemble as a principled technique against learning under noisy labels. Our motivation stems from the observation that DNNs start to learn from easy samples in initial phases and gradually adapt to hard ones during training.	0.7902077837136257
en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	Consequently  training DNNs with traditional learning procedures on noisy data strongly deteriorates their ability to generalize – a severe problem.Hence  limiting the inﬂuence of label noise is of great practical importance. A common approach to mitigate the negative inﬂuence of noisy labels is to eliminate them from the training data and train deep learning models just with the clean labels (Fr´enay & Verleysen  2013).	0.7902453522714908

en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	 When learning under label noise  the network receives noisy updates and hence ﬂuctuates strongly.Such conduct of training would impede to learn stable neural representations and further mislead the consensus of the predictions.Therefore  it is essential to incorporate a model with stable training behavior to obtain better estimates from the consensus.	0.8057531102986731

en_trf_robertabase_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	 Laine & Aila (2016); Luo et al (2018) proposed to apply semi-supervised techniques on the data to counteract noise.These and other semi-supervised learning techniques learn from a static  initial set of noisy labels and have no mechanisms to repair labels.Therefore  the supervised losses in their learning objective are typically high until the model strongly overfits to the label noise.	0.9775320731252066

en_trf_robertabase_lg	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	Other cat samples would encourage the model to predict the given cat image as a cat.Contrary  the wrong label tiger regularly pulls the model back to predict the cat as a tiger.Hence  using the model’s predictions gathered in one single training epoch for filtering is sub-optimal.	0.9777523584955229

[[0.66139185]]
Google_USE	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	Clean labels erroneously removed in an earlier iteration (e.g.  labels of hard to classify samples) can be reconsidered for model training again in later iterations. Filtering strategy The model can determine the set of potentially correct labels Li based on agree- ment between the label y and its maximal likelihood prediction ˆy|x with Li = {(y  x) | ˆyx = y; ∀(y  x) ∈ L0}.L0 is the label set provided in the beginning  (y  x) are the samples and their respective noisy labels in the iteration i. In other words  the labels are only used for supervised training if in the current epoch  the model predicts the respective label to be the correct class with the highest likelihood.	[[0.6617365]]
Google_USE	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	Since wrong labels cause strong ﬂuctuations in the model’s predictions  using ensembles is a natural way to counteract noisy labels. Concretely  in each iteration  the model learns from a detected set of potentially correct labels and maintains a running average of model snapshots (realized by the Mean Teacher model Tarvainen & Valpola (2017)).This ensemble model is evaluated on the entire dataset and provides an additional learning signal for training the single models.

Google_USE	How can overfitting on noisy labels be avoided	When trained on wrongly labeled data  DNNs learn from clean labels at ease and receive inconsistent error signals from the noisy labels before over-fitting to the dataset.The network’s prediction is likely to be consistent on clean samples and inconsistent or oscillates strongly on wrongly labeled samples over different training iterations.Based on this observation  we record the outputs of a single network made on different training epochs and treat them as an ensemble of predictions obtained from different individual networks.
