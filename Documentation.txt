SQueRT: The Scientific Query Research Tool

SQueRT is a web application that assists researchers by leveraging artificial intelligence to query the latest academic literature. It utilizes the state-of-the-art natural language processing deep learning models ALBERT and DistilBERT to search the academic literature database arXiv for articles  relevant to the user's query. SQueRT can greatly reduce the time and effort necessary find reported answers to research questions.

Architecture
SQueRT is a Flask application with SQLite database support that runs in two primary stages. In the first stage, a web scraper is employed to scrape PDFs from arXiv.org based on the user's input. The text from the PDFs is processed and DistilBERT used to locate relevant text snippets. In the second stage, ALBERT is employed to rank candidate snippets according to their relevance to the user's query. Results are displayed on the web page, including a link to the PDF that contains the answer returned by SQueRT. The script Main.py acts as the Controller for the program. For a comprehensive list of packages used, see requirements.txt.

User Manual
Before attempting to run SQueRt, ensure that you have all the required packages installed. These are enumerated in requirements.txt. 
The entry point to SQueRT is the script app.py.
To run:
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where SQueRT is located. On the command line, type "python app.py". The message "Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080" will appear shortly in Terminal. When it does, copy and paste the link http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a web browser. 
Note: Port 8080 must not be in use. If it is, you can either kill the running process and then try running app.py again or you can alter the port in the app.py script.
