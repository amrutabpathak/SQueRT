<EOS>
b'Graph, which comprises a set of vertices/nodes together with connected edges, is a formal structural\nrepresentation of non-regular data.Due to the strong representation ability, it accommodates many\npotential applications, e.g., social network (Orsini et al., 2017), world wide data (Page et al., 1999),\nknowledge graph (Xu et al., 2017), and protein-interaction network (Borgwardt et al., 2007).Among\nthese, semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation on graphs is one of the most interesting also popular topics.'
<EOS>
b'Given a graph in which some nodes are labeled, the aim of semi-supervised classi\xef\xac\x81cation is to infer\nthe categories of those remaining unlabeled nodes by using various priors of the graph.While there have been numerous previous works (Brandes et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2004; Zhu\net al., 2003; Yang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019)devoted to semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation\nbased on explicit graph Laplacian regularizations, it is hard to ef\xef\xac\x81ciently boost the performance of\nlabel prediction due to the strict assumption that connected nodes are likely to share the same label\ninformation.'
<EOS>
b'With the progress of deep learning on grid-shaped images/videos(He et al., 2016),a few of graph convolutional neural networks (CNN) based methods, including spectral ('
<EOS>
b'Kipf &\nWelling, 2017) and spatial methods (Niepert et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018), have\nbeen proposed to learn local convolution \xef\xac\x81lters on graphs in order to extract more discriminative\nnode representations.Although graph CNN based methods have achieved considerable capabilities\nof graph embedding by optimizing \xef\xac\x81lters, they are limited into a conventionally semi-supervised\nframework and lack of an ef\xef\xac\x81cient inference mechanism on graphs.Especially, in the case of few-shot\nlearning, where a small number of training nodes are labeled, this kind of methods would drastically\ncompromise the performance.'

b'The illustration of our proposed GIL framework.For the problem of graph node labeling, the category\ninformation of these unlabeled nodes depends on the similarity computation between a query node (e.g., vj)\nand these labeled reference nodes (e.g., vi).We consider the similarity from three points: node attributes,\nthe consistency of local topological structures (i.e., the circle with dashed line), and the between-node path\nreachability (i.e., the red wave line from vi to vj).'
<EOS>
b'Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, the local structures as well as node attributes are\nencoded as high-level features with graph convolution, while the between-node path reachability is abstracted as\nreachable probabilities of random walks.To better make the inference generalize to test nodes, we introduce a\nmeta-learning strategy to optimize the structure relations learning from training nodes to validation nodes.of 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, but only 0.3% nodes are labeled for the semi-supervised node\nclassi\xef\xac\x81cation task.'
<EOS>
b'These aforementioned works usually boil down to a general classi\xef\xac\x81cation task,\nwhere the model is learnt on a training set and selected by checking a validation set.However, they\ndo not put great efforts on how to learn to infer from one node to another node on a topological graph,\nespecially in the few-shot regime.In this paper, we propose a graph inference learning (GIL) framework to teach the model itself to\nadaptively infer from reference labeled nodes to those query unlabeled nodes, and \xef\xac\x81nally boost the\nperformance of semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation in the case of a few number of labeled samples.'
<EOS>
b'Given an input graph, GIL attempts to infer the unlabeled nodes from those observed nodes by\nbuilding between-node relations.The between-node relations are structured as the integration of\nnode attributes, connection paths, and graph topological structures.It means that the similarity\nbetween two nodes is decided from three aspects: the consistency of node attributes, the consistency\nof local topological structures, and the between-node path reachability, as shown in Fig.'
<EOS>
b'1.The local\nstructures anchored around each node as well as the attributes of nodes therein are jointly encoded\nwith graph convolution (Defferrard et al., 2016) for the sake of high-level feature extraction.For the\nbetween-node path reachability, we adopt the random walk algorithm to obtain the characteristics\nfrom a labeled reference node vi to a query unlabeled node vj in a given graph.'
<EOS>
b'Based on the\ncomputed node representation and between-node reachability, the structure relations can be obtained\nby computing the similar scores/relationships from reference nodes to unlabeled nodes in a graph.Inspired by the recent meta-learning strategy (Finn et al., 2017), we learn to infer the structure\nrelations from a training set to a validation set, which can bene\xef\xac\x81t the generalization capability of the\nlearned model.In other words, our proposed GIL attempts to learn some transferable knowledge\nunderlying in the structure relations from training samples to validation samples, such that the learned\nstructure relations can be better self-adapted to the new testing stage.'
<EOS>
b'We summarize the main contributions of this work as three folds:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2We propose a novel graph inference learning framework by building structure relations to\ninfer unknown node labels from those labeled nodes in an end-to-end way.The structure\nrelations are well de\xef\xac\x81ned by jointly considering node attributes, between-node paths, and\ngraph topological structures.'
<EOS>
b'\xe2\x80\xa2To make the inference model better generalize to test nodes, we introduce a meta-learning\nprocedure to optimize structure relations, which could be the \xef\xac\x81rst time for graph nodeclassi\xef\xac\x81cation to the best of our knowledge.'

<EOS>
b'Zhang et al., 2020) have been exploited to analyze\nthe irregular graph-structured data.For better extending general convolutional neural networks to\ngraph domains, two broad strategies have been proposed, including spectral and spatial convolution\nmethods.Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, spectral \xef\xac\x81ltering methods (Henaff et al., 2015; Kipf & Welling, 2017) develop\nconvolution-like operators in the spectral domain, and then perform a series of spectral \xef\xac\x81lters\nby decomposing the graph Laplacian.'
<EOS>
b'Unfortunately, the spectral-based approaches often lead\nto a high computational complex due to the operation of eigenvalue decomposition, especially\nfor a large number of graph nodes.To alleviate this computation burden, local spectral \xef\xac\x81ltering\nmethods (Defferrard et al., 2016) are then proposed by parameterizing the frequency responses as a\nChebyshev polynomial approximation.Another type of graph CNNs, namely spatial methods (Li et al.,\n2016; Niepert et al., 2016), can perform the \xef\xac\x81ltering operation by de\xef\xac\x81ning the spatial structures of\nadjacent vertices.'

<EOS>
b'sets, the aim is to predict the node labels of testing nodes by using node attributes as well as edge\nconnections.A sophisticated machine learning technique used in most existing methods (Kipf &\nWelling, 2017; Zhou et al., 2004) is to choose the optimal classi\xef\xac\x81er (trained on a training set) after\nchecking the performance on the validation set.However, these methods essentially ignore how to\nextract transferable knowledge from these known labeled nodes to unlabeled nodes, as the graph\nstructure itself implies node connectivity/reachability.'
<EOS>
b'Moreover, due to the scarcity of labeled\nsamples, the performance of such a classi\xef\xac\x81er is usually not satisfying.To address these issues,\nwe introduce a meta-learning mechanism (Finn et al., 2017; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017; Sung et al.,\n2017) to learn to infer node labels on graphs.Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, the graph structure, between-node path\nreachability, and node attributes are jointly modeled into the learning process.'

b'In this work, we tackled the semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation task with a graph inference learningmethod, which can better predict the categories of these unlabeled nodes in an end-to-end framework.We can build a structure relation for obtaining the connection between any two graph nodes, where\nnode attributes, between-node paths, and graph structure information can be encapsulated together.'
