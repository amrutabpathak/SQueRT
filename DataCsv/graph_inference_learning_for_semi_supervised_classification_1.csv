b'ABSTRACT'
<EOS>
b'In this work, we address semi-supervised classi\xef\xac\x81cation of graph data, where the\ncategories of those unlabeled nodes are inferred from labeled nodes as well as\ngraph structures.'
<EOS>
b'Recent works often solve this problem via advanced graph\nconvolution in a conventionally supervised manner, but the performance could\ndegrade signi\xef\xac\x81cantly when labeled data is scarce.'
<EOS>
b'To this end, we propose a\nGraph Inference Learning (GIL) framework to boost the performance of semi-'
<EOS>
b'supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation by learning the inference of node labels on graph\ntopology.'
<EOS>
b'To bridge the connection between two nodes, we formally de\xef\xac\x81ne a\nstructure relation by encapsulating node attributes, between-node paths, and local\ntopological structures together, which can make the inference conveniently deduced\nfrom one node to another node.'
<EOS>
b'For learning the inference process, we further\nintroduce meta-optimization on structure relations from training nodes to validation\nnodes, such that the learnt graph inference capability can be better self-adapted to\ntesting nodes.'
<EOS>
b'Comprehensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (including\nCora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and NELL) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed\nGIL when compared against state-of-the-art methods on the semi-supervised node\nclassi\xef\xac\x81cation task.'

b'INTRODUCTION'
<EOS>
b'Graph, which comprises a set of vertices/nodes together with connected edges, is a formal structural\nrepresentation of non-regular data.'
<EOS>
b'Due to the strong representation ability, it accommodates many\npotential applications, e.g., social network (Orsini et al., 2017), world wide data (Page et al., 1999),\nknowledge graph (Xu et al., 2017), and protein-interaction network (Borgwardt et al., 2007).'
<EOS>
b'Among\nthese, semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation on graphs is one of the most interesting also popular topics.'
<EOS>
b'Given a graph in which some nodes are labeled, the aim of semi-supervised classi\xef\xac\x81cation is to infer\nthe categories of those remaining unlabeled nodes by using various priors of the graph.'
<EOS>
b'While there have been numerous previous works (Brandes et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2004; Zhu\net al., 2003; Yang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019)'
<EOS>
b'devoted to semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation\nbased on explicit graph Laplacian regularizations, it is hard to ef\xef\xac\x81ciently boost the performance of\nlabel prediction due to the strict assumption that connected nodes are likely to share the same label\ninformation.'
<EOS>
b'With the progress of deep learning on grid-shaped images/videos'
<EOS>
b'(He et al., 2016),'
<EOS>
b'a few of graph convolutional neural networks (CNN) based methods, including spectral ('
<EOS>
b'Kipf &\nWelling, 2017) and spatial methods (Niepert et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018), have\nbeen proposed to learn local convolution \xef\xac\x81lters on graphs in order to extract more discriminative\nnode representations.'
<EOS>
b'Although graph CNN based methods have achieved considerable capabilities\nof graph embedding by optimizing \xef\xac\x81lters, they are limited into a conventionally semi-supervised\nframework and lack of an ef\xef\xac\x81cient inference mechanism on graphs.'
<EOS>
b'Especially, in the case of few-shot\nlearning, where a small number of training nodes are labeled, this kind of methods would drastically\ncompromise the performance.'

<EOS>
b'The illustration of our proposed GIL framework.'
<EOS>
b'For the problem of graph node labeling, the category\ninformation of these unlabeled nodes depends on the similarity computation between a query node (e.g., vj)\nand these labeled reference nodes (e.g., vi).'
<EOS>
b'We consider the similarity from three points: node attributes,\nthe consistency of local topological structures (i.e., the circle with dashed line), and the between-node path\nreachability (i.e., the red wave line from vi to vj).'
<EOS>
b'Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, the local structures as well as node attributes are\nencoded as high-level features with graph convolution, while the between-node path reachability is abstracted as\nreachable probabilities of random walks.'
<EOS>
b'To better make the inference generalize to test nodes, we introduce a\nmeta-learning strategy to optimize the structure relations learning from training nodes to validation nodes.'
<EOS>
b'of 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges, but only 0.3% nodes are labeled for the semi-supervised node\nclassi\xef\xac\x81cation task.'
<EOS>
b'These aforementioned works usually boil down to a general classi\xef\xac\x81cation task,\nwhere the model is learnt on a training set and selected by checking a validation set.'
<EOS>
b'However, they\ndo not put great efforts on how to learn to infer from one node to another node on a topological graph,\nespecially in the few-shot regime.'
<EOS>
b'In this paper, we propose a graph inference learning (GIL) framework to teach the model itself to\nadaptively infer from reference labeled nodes to those query unlabeled nodes, and \xef\xac\x81nally boost the\nperformance of semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation in the case of a few number of labeled samples.'
<EOS>
b'Given an input graph, GIL attempts to infer the unlabeled nodes from those observed nodes by\nbuilding between-node relations.'
<EOS>
b'The between-node relations are structured as the integration of\nnode attributes, connection paths, and graph topological structures.'
<EOS>
b'It means that the similarity\nbetween two nodes is decided from three aspects: the consistency of node attributes, the consistency\nof local topological structures, and the between-node path reachability, as shown in Fig.'
<EOS>
b'1.'
<EOS>
b'The local\nstructures anchored around each node as well as the attributes of nodes therein are jointly encoded\nwith graph convolution (Defferrard et al., 2016) for the sake of high-level feature extraction.'
<EOS>
b'For the\nbetween-node path reachability, we adopt the random walk algorithm to obtain the characteristics\nfrom a labeled reference node vi to a query unlabeled node vj in a given graph.'
<EOS>
b'Based on the\ncomputed node representation and between-node reachability, the structure relations can be obtained\nby computing the similar scores/relationships from reference nodes to unlabeled nodes in a graph.'
<EOS>
b'Inspired by the recent meta-learning strategy (Finn et al., 2017), we learn to infer the structure\nrelations from a training set to a validation set, which can bene\xef\xac\x81t the generalization capability of the\nlearned model.'
<EOS>
b'In other words, our proposed GIL attempts to learn some transferable knowledge\nunderlying in the structure relations from training samples to validation samples, such that the learned\nstructure relations can be better self-adapted to the new testing stage.'

b'Graph CNNs: With the rapid development of deep learning methods, various graph convolution\nneural networks (Kashima et al., 2003; Morris et al., 2017; Shervashidze et al., 2009; Yanardag\n& Vishwanathan, 2015; Jiang et al., 2019;'
<EOS>
b'Zhang et al., 2020) have been exploited to analyze\nthe irregular graph-structured data.'
<EOS>
b'For better extending general convolutional neural networks to\ngraph domains, two broad strategies have been proposed, including spectral and spatial convolution\nmethods.'
<EOS>
b'Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, spectral \xef\xac\x81ltering methods (Henaff et al., 2015; Kipf & Welling, 2017) develop\nconvolution-like operators in the spectral domain, and then perform a series of spectral \xef\xac\x81lters\nby decomposing the graph Laplacian.'
<EOS>
b'Unfortunately, the spectral-based approaches often lead\nto a high computational complex due to the operation of eigenvalue decomposition, especially\nfor a large number of graph nodes.'
<EOS>
b'To alleviate this computation burden, local spectral \xef\xac\x81ltering\nmethods (Defferrard et al., 2016) are then proposed by parameterizing the frequency responses as a\nChebyshev polynomial approximation.'
<EOS>
b'Another type of graph CNNs, namely spatial methods (Li et al.,\n2016; Niepert et al., 2016), can perform the \xef\xac\x81ltering operation by de\xef\xac\x81ning the spatial structures of\nadjacent vertices.'
<EOS>
b'Various approaches can be employed to aggregate or sort neighboring vertices, such\nas diffusion CNNs (Atwood & Towsley, 2016), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), PSCN ('
<EOS>
b'Niepert\net al., 2016), and NgramCNN'
<EOS>
b'(Luo et al., 2017).'

b'From the perspective of data distribution, recently,\nthe Gaussian induced convolution model (Jiang et al., 2019) is proposed to disentangle the aggregation\nprocess through encoding adjacent regions with Gaussian mixture model.'

b'Semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation:'
<EOS>
b'Among various graph-related applications, semi-supervised'
<EOS>
b'node classi\xef\xac\x81cation has gained increasing attention recently, and various approaches have been\nproposed to deal with this problem, including explicit graph Laplacian regularization and graph-'

b'the label propagation method using Gaussian random \xef\xac\x81elds (Zhu et al., 2003),'

b'the regularization\nframework by relying on the local/global consistency (Zhou et al., 2004), and the random walk-'
<EOS>
b'based sampling algorithm for acquiring the context information (Yang et al., 2016).'
<EOS>
b'To further\naddress scalable semi-supervised learning issues (Liu et al., 2012), the Anchor Graph regularization\napproach (Liu et al., 2010) is proposed to scale linearly with the number of graph nodes and then\napplied to massive-scale graph datasets.'
<EOS>
b'Several graph convolution network methods (Abu-El-Haija\net al., 2018; Du et al., 2017; Thekumparampil et al., 2018; Velickovic et al., 2018; Zhuang & Ma,\n2018) are then developed to obtain discriminative representations of input graphs.'
<EOS>
b'For example, Kipf\net al.'
<EOS>
b'(Kipf & Welling, 2017) proposed a scalable graph CNN model, which can scale linearly in the\nnumber of graph edges and learn graph representations by encoding both local graph structures and'
<EOS>
b'node attributes.'
<EOS>
b'Graph attention networks (GAT) ('
<EOS>
b'Velickovic et al., 2018) are proposed to compute\nhidden representations of each node for attending to its neighbors with a self-attention strategy.'
<EOS>
b'By jointly considering the local- and global-consistency information, dual graph convolutional\nnetworks (Zhuang & Ma, 2018) are presented to deal with semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation.'
<EOS>
b'The\ncritical difference between our proposed GIL and those previous semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation'
<EOS>
b'methods is to adopt a graph inference strategy by de\xef\xac\x81ning structure relations on graphs and'

b'then\nleverage a meta optimization mechanism to learn an inference model, which could be the \xef\xac\x81rst time to\nthe best of our knowledge, while the existing graph CNNs take semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation\nas a general classi\xef\xac\x81cation task.'

<EOS>
b'We consider the task of semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation over graph data, where only a small\nnumber of vertices are labeled for the model learning, i.e., |VLabel| (cid:28) |V|.'
<EOS>
b'Generally, we have three'
<EOS>
b'node sets:'

b'a training set Vtr, a validation set Vval, and a testing set Vte.'
<EOS>
b'In the standard protocol\n\n3\n\n\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2020\n\nof prior literatures (Yang et al., 2016), the three node sets share the same label space.'

b'We follow\nbut do not restrict this protocol for our proposed method.'
<EOS>
b'Given the training and validation node'
<EOS>
b'sets, the aim is to predict the node labels of testing nodes by using node attributes as well as edge\nconnections.'
<EOS>
b'A sophisticated machine learning technique used in most existing methods (Kipf &\nWelling, 2017; Zhou et al., 2004) is to choose the optimal classi\xef\xac\x81er (trained on a training set) after\nchecking the performance on the validation set.'
<EOS>
b'However, these methods essentially ignore how to\nextract transferable knowledge from these known labeled nodes to unlabeled nodes, as the graph\nstructure itself implies node connectivity/reachability.'
<EOS>
b'Moreover, due to the scarcity of labeled\nsamples, the performance of such a classi\xef\xac\x81er is usually not satisfying.'
<EOS>
b'To address these issues,\nwe introduce a meta-learning mechanism (Finn et al., 2017; Ravi & Larochelle, 2017; Sung et al.,\n2017) to learn to infer node labels on graphs.'
<EOS>
b'Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, the graph structure, between-node path\nreachability, and node attributes are jointly modeled into the learning process.'

<EOS>
b'Note'
<EOS>
b'that the last one fr de\xef\xac\x81nes on the former two ones, so we consider the cases in Table 4 by adding\nmodules.'
<EOS>
b'When not using all modules, only original attributes of nodes are used to predict labels.'
<EOS>
b'The case of only using fe belongs to the GCN method, which can achieve 81.5% on the Cora dataset.'
<EOS>
b'The large gain of using the relation module fr (i.e., from 81.5% to 85.0%) may be contributed to the\nability of inference learning on attributes as well as local topology structures which are implicitly\nencoded in fe.'
<EOS>
b'The path information fP can further boost the performance by 1.2%, e.g., 86.2% vs\n85.0%.'
<EOS>
b'It demonstrates that three different modules of our method can improve the graph inference\nlearning capability.'
<EOS>

<EOS>
b'Compared with those classic Graph\nCNNs (Kipf & Welling, 2017), our proposed GIL has a slightly higher cost due to an extra inference\nlearning process, but can complete the testing stage with several seconds on these benchmark datasets.'
<EOS>
b'6 CONCLUSION'
<EOS>
b'In this work, we tackled the semi-supervised node classi\xef\xac\x81cation task with a graph inference learning'
<EOS>
b'method, which can better predict the categories of these unlabeled nodes in an end-to-end framework.'
<EOS>
b'We can build a structure relation for obtaining the connection between any two graph nodes, where\nnode attributes, between-node paths, and graph structure information can be encapsulated together.'
<EOS>
b'For better capturing the transferable knowledge, our method further learns to transfer the mined\nknowledge from the training samples to the validation set, \xef\xac\x81nally boosting the prediction accuracy\nof the labels of unlabeled nodes in the testing set.'
<EOS>
b'The extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed GIL for solving the semi-supervised learning problem, even in\nthe few-shot paradigm.'
<EOS>
b'In the future, we would extend the graph inference method to handle more\ngraph-related tasks, such as graph generation and social network analysis.'
