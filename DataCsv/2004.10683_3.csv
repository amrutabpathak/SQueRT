In this work, we perform a systematical analysis of the ﬂavor structure of DM annihila-  tions into charged leptons based on the cosmic ray CRE spectra measured by DAMPE,  Fermi-LAT, AMS-02, and CALET experiments.We study the annihilations of possible  TeV scale DM particles in a nearby subhalo, which is proposed to explain the possible  peak-like structure of the DAMPE CRE data.

We pay special attention to the possi-  ble non-resonant excess (besides the possible peak-like structure) and demonstrate that  such non-resonant excess can mainly arise from the decay of muons produced by the DM  annihilations in the subhalo.With these we study the ﬂavor composition of the lepton final states of χχ→ e+e−, µ+µ−, τ +τ− by fitting the CRE data.We further analyze the constraints on the lepton ﬂavor composition using the Fermi-LAT γ-ray measurements.
<EOS>
 We find that the ﬂavor composition (favored by the CRE data) is consistent with the  Fermi-LAT data at relatively low Galactic latitudes, while the fraction of the final state τ± is severely bounded. ∗Email: gesf@sjtu.edu.cn †Email: hjhe@sjtu.edu.cn, hjhe@tsinghua.edu.cn ‡Email: wang-yc15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn §Email: yuanq@pmo.ac.cn  0 2 0 2    r p A 2 2         ] E H h p - o r t s a [      1 v 3 8 6 0 1  4 0 0 2 : v i X r a  Contents  1.Introduction.............................

<EOS>
There have been very active experimental activities to measure the cosmic ray electron/positron spectrum up to TeV energy scale, including the ground-based and space- borne experiments such as HESS [3], VERITAS [4], Fermi-LAT [6], AMS-02 [5], and CALET [7].Measuring the high energy CRE spectrum opens up an important window for the indirect detection of DM particles. Among these experimental activities, the first announcement of the CRE energy spectrum measurement from 25 GeV up to 4.6 TeV [8] by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) detector [9] provided some intriguing results.
<EOS>
The DAMPE satellite was launched in December, 2015 and is optimized for detecting cosmic e± events and γ rays up to about 10 TeV energy.The first CRE result of DAMPE collaboration was based on 530 days of data-taking [8].The fitted CRE spectrum shows a spectral break around 0.9 TeV and is consistent with the HESS result [3].
<EOS>
The DAMPE CRE data also show a tentative peak-like event excess around (1.3− 1.5) TeV, which stimulated numerious studies on its possible interpretations [10]-[17], ranging from the conventional astrophysical sources (including pulsars and supernova remnants) to models of dark matter annihilations or decays into e+e− events [18]. Our previous study [16] revealed a significant new hidden excess in the energy region (0.6− 1.1) TeV on the left-hand-side of the peak bin (1.3−1.5) TeV, and we proposed that this new excess originates from decays of the 1.5 TeV µ± (τ±) events which are produced together with the 1.5 TeV e± peak events. In this work, we perform a systematical analysis of the ﬂavor structure of the CRE spec- tra and study their implications for indirect DM searches including the DAMPE, Fermi- LAT and CALET experiments.
<EOS>
We make improved analysis with a physical CRE back- ground, which is composed of the primary electrons produced by galactic supernova remnants (SNR) and the secondary electrons from the collision between primary nuclei and interstellar medium (ISM).We study annihilations of TeV scale DM particles into charged lepton pairs (e+e−, µ+µ−, τ +τ−) in a nearby subhalo.In addition to the possible peak-like structure mea- sured by DAMPE, we pay special attention to the possible non-resonant excess mentioned above.
<EOS>
We will show that the resultant CRE spectrum is consistent with the current CRE data of DAMPE and Fermi-LAT, and also the AMS-02 and CALET data.We demonstrate that including the muon decay channel not only improves the fitting quality, but also gives important constraint on the ﬂavor structure of final state leptons from DM annihilations.We also take into account the photon radiation of the final state leptons, and derive nontrivial constraints on the ﬂavor compositions of the final state leptons from the γ ray measurements  3  of Fermi-LAT.
<EOS>
 This paper is organized as follows.In Section 2, we first revisit our previous study [16], in which we fit the DAMPE data with a double-broken power-law background and with CRE signals from χχ → e+e−, µ+µ−, τ +τ− channels.Then, we perform improved analysis with a physical CRE background and the CRE signal spectrum from DM annihilations in both e+e− and µ+µ−(τ +τ−) channels.
<EOS>
With these we derive constraints on the ﬂavor composition of the final state leptons from DM annihilations.We further estimate the increased sensitivities by the projected future DAMPE running.In Section 3, we fit the Fermi-LAT, AMS-02 and CALET data, and show the consistency with the µ± (τ±) decay contribution invoked for explaining the DAMPE data.
<EOS>
In Section 4, we further use the γ-ray measurement of Fermi- LAT to constrain the ﬂavor composition of the final state leptons.Finally, we conclude in Section 5. 2.
<EOS>
Improved Fit to the DAMPE CRE Spectrum  In our previous study [16], we used an empirical broken power-law formula to fit the back- ground.In the present work, we will use a better justified CRE physical background instead and perform a more realistic analysis.In addition, we will allow the DM mass as a free parameter for the fit.
<EOS>
 2.1. Fit with Broken Power-Law Background  In this subsection, we review what was done in Ref. [16], as a comparison with our new analysis in the current study.For clarity of our presentation, we replot in Fig 1 all the DAMPE data points with ±1σ errors [8].From this, we observed [16] that the DAMPE data points exhibit another rather intriguing structure on the left-hand-side of the peak region (1.3− 1.5) TeV.
<EOS>
We found that the energy range of (0.616−1.07) TeV contains five consecutive data points (marked in red color), which all lie above the background curve (as fitted from the other background points marked in black color).These five red data points are distinctive and form a non-peak-like new excess with (cid:38) 2σ significance. In Ref. [16], an empirical broken power-law formula is adopted to describe the CRE back- grounds, without taking into account their origin (including the sources and the propaga- tion eﬀect).
<EOS>
We first fit the background without including the five red data points over (0.616−1.07) TeV and the blue peak point at (1.3−1.5) TeV shown in Fig 1.The fit gives a minimum χ2 per degree of freedom (d.o.f.), χ2/d.o.f = 3.95/23 = 0.172We show the back- ground fit as the black dashed curve in Fig 1. We then fit all the data points over the 25 GeV−2.6 TeV region by adding the DM annihi-  4  Figure 1: Fitting the CRE spectrum of DAMPE data.

The fit of the background contribution is shown by the black dashed curve; the fit further including the decay contribution from 1.5 TeV µ± (τ±) composition is depicted by the red dashed curve; and the fit further including 1.5 TeV e± peak- like contribution is given by the blue curve [16].The DAMPE data [8] are shown by the dots with ±1σ error bars. lation contributions χχ→ e+e− and χχ→ µ+µ−(τ +τ−)→ e+e− to the background.
<EOS>
For this analysis, we consider the DM particles with mass Mχ = 1.5 TeV and suppose that they are ac- cumulated in a nearby DM subhalo whose density distribution is described by the generalized NFW profile [19], ρχ(r) ≡ ρs(r/rs)−γ(1+ r/rs)γ−3, with ρs = 100 GeV/cm3, rs = 0.1 kpc, and γ = 0.5We set the distance between the earth and the subhalo center as ds = 0.2 kpcFor the CRE spectra at source, the annihilation channel χχ→ e+e− produces e± ﬂux with exactly 1.5 TeV energy, while the energy spectrum of e± from χχ→ µ+µ−(τ +τ−)→ e+e− channels is given by  (cid:18) 5  12  (cid:19)  1 Ne  dNe dEe  (cid:39) 4 Mχ  − 3E2 e 4M 2 χ  +  E3 e 3M 3 χ  ,  (2.1)  where the final states e± arise from the 3-body-decays µ → e¯νeνµ or τ → e¯νeντWe note that µ and τ share almost the same decay spectra due to their energy E = Mχ (cid:29) mµ, mτ , except for their diﬀerent decay branching fractions Br[µ→ e¯νeνµ](cid:39) 100% and Br[τ → e¯νeντ ](cid:39) 17.82%(cid:39) 1/5.6 [20].The lifetime of ﬂying µ± with energy Eµ = 1.5 TeV is about 0.031s and could travel a distance about 9.36×106 m. The lifetime of τ± is shorter than µ± by another 7 orders of magnitude.Thus, the distances which µ± and τ± ﬂuxes could travel before their decays are negligible as compared to rs and dsSo we can treat the initial e± ﬂuxes from all channels as produced at the source.

(The propagation part will be further described in Section 2.3.) We fit the e± and µ± (τ±) spectra together for the DAMPE data.This fit gives χ2/d.o.f = 16.5/27 = 0.609 , which has a better quality than any other naive fits (with the peak bin included). From the above fit, we also derive the thermally averaged cross sections of the DM an- nihilations: (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 1.72× 10−26 cm3/s and (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ + 0.178(cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = 1.47× 10−25 cm3/sTheir ratio (with 1σ bound) is given by y = yµ + yτ = 8.6+1.4−2.5 , where yµ = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ/(cid:104)σv(cid:105)e and yτ = 0.178(cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ /(cid:104)σv(cid:105)eWe further deduce the 90% confidence limit (C.L.), y = 2.6 − 10.8For lepton portal DM models [10, 21], we derive a non-trivial bound on the lepton-DM- mediator couplings λj (j = e, µ, τ ) [16],  (cid:18)  (cid:19)1  4  λe :  λ4 µ +  1 6  λ4 τ  = 1 : y  1 4 ,  (2.3)  with a fairly narrow range y 1  4 (cid:39) 1.3−1.8 (90% C.L.).
<EOS>
 2.2. Physical Spectra for the CRE Backgrounds  In the previous subsection, we discussed fitting the CRE backgrounds with the empirical broken power-law formula as in Ref. [16].For the current study, we will consider the physical components of the CRE backgrounds.The CRE backgrounds consist of the primary electrons from supernova remnants (SNR) and the secondary electrons/positrons produced by inelastic hadronic interactions of cosmic ray nuclei in the interstellar medium (ISM) [18].
<EOS>
They can be estimated numerically by the LIKEDM code [22]. trum can be formulated as [22],  The primary electrons are considered to mainly arise from the SNR.Their injection spec-  (cid:19)−γ2(cid:34)  (cid:18) Es  1GeV  (cid:18) Es  Ebr2  1 +  (cid:19)2(cid:35)γ2−γ3  2  (cid:18)  exp  − Es Ecut  (cid:19)  ,  (2.4)  dN dEs  = Ae  (cid:38) 20 GeV.
<EOS>
To estimate the primary electron background spectrum after propagation,  for Es we first approximate the injection spectrum with a series of Gaussian kernels,  n(cid:88)  j=1  dN dEs  =  Cj√ 2π σj  exp  −(Es−Ej)2  2σ2 j  (cid:20)  (cid:21)  ,  (2.5)  where Ej = 0.01×10(j−1)/7 GeV and σj = 0.15Ej for n = 50 [22].The post-propagation ﬂux for each Gaussian kernel, Φi(Ee), is included in the LIKEDM code.For the present analysis,  6  n(cid:88)  we will adopt its third set of the propagation parameters, in which the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is parametrized as D(x, E) = D0(E/4GeV)δ with D0 = 7.1×1028cm2/s and δ = 0.33 [22].
<EOS>
Thus, we obtain the total primary electron ﬂux as a linear combination  Φ(Ee) =  CjΦj(Ee) (2.6)  j=1  The secondary e+ ﬂux is computed according to the cosmic ray proton and Helium nuclei interactions with the ISM during their propagation.The secondary e− shares almost the same spectrum as the secondary e+, but has an additional suppression factor of 0.6 [22].This spectrum is also provided by the LIKEDM code.
<EOS>
Since the solar modulation eﬀect is only significant in the low energy region E < 10 GeV, it can be neglected in our fit. 2.3. CRE Spectra from DM Annihilations  We use the PPPC4DMID [23][24] package to calculate the electron spectra of the DM annihilation processes χχ → e+e− and χχ → µ+µ−(τ +τ−) → e+e−.The final state radiation (FSR) in the DM annihilation process will soften the CRE spectra.
<EOS>
In Fig 2(a), we show the injection spectra before and after FSR as dashed and solid curves, respectively.For clarity of presentation, we also rescaled the spectra of µ± decay channel by an extra enhanecment factor of 50.Here we do not distinguish the spectra of µ± and τ± channels, since their shapes are rather similar except that the τ± channel is suppressed by the much lower branching fraction of the 3-body-decays of τ±.
<EOS>
 Next, we analyze the propagation of the e± ﬂux from the nearby DM subhalo.When traveling across the interstellar space, CREs experience diﬀusion and energy loss, as described by the following propagation equation,  ∂Ne ∂t  − ∂[b(x, E)Ne]  − ∇(D(x, E)∇Ne) = Q ,  (2.7) where Ne(Ee, t, x) is the number density distribution as a function of the e± energy Ee and the spacetime coordinates (t, x). ∂E  The energy loss, b(E) ≡ −dE/dt , is defined as [23]:  (cid:34)  (cid:88)  i  (cid:35)  b(x, E) =  4σT 3m2 e  E2  uB(x) +  u(i) γ (x, E)  ,  (2.8)  where uB = 1 2B2 stands for the energy density contribution from the galactic magnetic fields, and u(i) is the energy density of photons from the CMB, starlight and dust-diﬀused infrared γ light.

In the above equation, σT = 8πα2 e) is the Thompson cross section.Since the size of the DM subhalo and its distance to earth are fairly small as compared to the galaxy size, we can ignore the x dependence of bFurthermore, at the location of solar system, which  em/(3m2  7  Figure 2: CRE energy spectrum at source and the ﬂuxes after their propagation to the earth.Plot (a) presents the injection spectra of the CRE from DM annihilations.

The blue curves show the e± channel and the red curves present the µ± decay channel.The spectra after including the FSR are given by solid curves, while those without FSR are shown by dashed curves.For clarity, the spectra of µ± decay channel is rescaled by an enhanecment factor of 50.

Plot (b) presents the CRE ﬂuxes after the propagation to the earth.For illustration, the thermally averaged annihilation cross section of each channel is chosen as (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 2.0×10−26 cm3/s and (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = 1.5×10−25 cm3/s, while the DM mass is set as Mχ = 1.5 TeV for both plots. is about 8 kpc away from our galaxy center, the galactic magnetic field is B ∼ 10−6 G, and hence uB is negligible.

[16], ρχ(r) ≡ ρs(r/rs)−γ(1 + r/rs)γ−3, with ρs = 100 GeV/cm3, rs = 0.1 kpc and γ = 0.5. We set the distance between the earth and the  4 for Dirac DM, and C = 1  4 hereafter.

Since Ee (cid:29) me holds for the DAMPE data, we have v (cid:39) cIn Fig 2(b), we plot the CRE ﬂux from all channels after e± signals propagate to the earth.

For illustration, we chose the thermally averaged annihilation cross section of each channel to be (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 2.0×10−26cm3/s and (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = 1.5×10−25cm3/s, and set the DM mass Mχ = 1.5 TeV. 2.4. Fitting Event Excesses in CRE Spectrum  The total e± ﬂux contains three parts, i.e., Φe ≡ Φbkg +Φdecay +Φpeak, where the ﬂux Φbkg denotes the CRE backgrounds, Φdecay arises from the decay contributions of the µ± (τ±) as produced from the DM annihilations, and Φpeak is the contribution of e± as produced by the DM annihilations.We fit the DAMPE data points by minimizing the χ2 function,  (cid:34)  (cid:88)  j  1 σj  (cid:32) Φj −  (cid:90) Eu  j  El j  dE  Φe(E) j −El Eu  j  (cid:33)(cid:35)2  χ2 =  (2.16)  where Φj, σj, El energy bounds of the jth bin, respectively.

 γ2 = 2.80,  (2.18)  The fitting quality is given by χ2/d.o.f. = 19.6/26 = 0.756 , which is fairly good.We note that the largest deviation between the data and our model comes from the (1.1−1.3) TeV bin in Fig 3(a), i.e., the black bin lying between the red bins and the blue peak bin, which is 2.8σ below the best fit value in the blue curve.This contributes about 40% of the total χ2 value.

We present our new fit of the CRE spectrum including the µ± (τ±) decay contribution (red curve) and the peak signal (blue curve) in Fig 3(a).Impressively, this demonstrates that including the µ± (τ±) decay events can fully explain this non-peak-like new excess over the  10  bkg+decay+peakbkg+decaybkgonly●DAMPE-decaybins■DAMPE-peakbin◆DAMPE-bkgbins105010050010005000050100150200250Ee[GeV]Ee3Φe[m-2s-1sr-1GeV2](a)DAMPEFit01020304001234yΔχ2(b)DAMPEFit0.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.00.51.01.52.02.53.0<σv>e[10-25cm3/s]<σv>μτ[10-25cm3/s](c)DAMPEFit90%C.L.68%C.L.(0.154,1.39)e±channalμ±(τ±)channal0102030400.050.10.515y<σv>[10-25cm3/s](d)DAMPEFitVarying Peak Signals  (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e (10−25cm3/s)  (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µτ (10−25cm3/s) Flavor Ratio y  original value  +1σ upper value −1σ lower value  0.154  0.215  0.094  1.39  1.30  1.47  9.0  6.1  15.7  Table 1: Fluctuation of the peak signals versus the contribution of µ± (τ±) channel.When the number of peak signal events ﬂuctuates within ±1σ range, the contribution of the e± channel varies accordingly (2nd column), but the contribution of µ± (τ±) channel (3rd column) only changes by less than 6% and remains nearly the same in the fit.

We scan the value of y in a wide range, and compute the ∆χ2 as a function of yThis is plotted as the blue curve in Fig 3(b).We find that the ﬂavor ratio with 1σ bounds is y = 9.0+8.4−4.2 , and its 90% confidence limits are 2.4 < y < 34.7 .1 If we set y = 0 , the best fit has its χ2 value increase to χ2/d.o.f. = 24.7/27 = 0.914For this case, the minimal χ2 increases by ∆χ2 = 5.02, in which the 5 non-resonant red bins contribute ∆χ2 = 4.68This shows that including the µ± (τ±) decay contribution (y > 0) for fitting the 5 red bins does play an important role to improve the fitting quality. In Fig 3(c), we marginalize the two cross sections, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e and (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µτ=(cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ+ 0.178(cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ , which determines the final state e± events from the 3-body decays of the final states µ± and τ±.
<EOS>
We show their 68% and 90% confidence limits as the yellow and light blue contours, respectively.Our fit demonstrates that a nonzero µ± (τ±) decay contribution is required at 90% C.L.  We also note that in Fig 3(c), the shapes of the ∆χ2 contours are close to ellipses with two axes nearly parallel to the horizontal/vertical directions, which means that the statistical correlation between the cross sections is quite weak.This fact means that these two parameters may be fitted independently.
<EOS>
We illustrate this point in Table 1.Here we ﬂuctuate the number of peak signal events by ±1σ and find that although the contribution of e± channel varies accordingly (2nd column), the contribution of µ± (τ±) channel only changes by less than 6% (3rd column) and remains nearly the same in the fit.Then, we note that the ﬂavor ratio y (4th column) has significant changes mainly due to the ﬂuctuation of peak signals.
<EOS>
It shows that even if the annihilation rate to the e± channel and hence the value of the ﬂavor ratio y may change significantly, the contribution from the non-resonant µ± (τ±) channel is largely  1This improved analysis diﬀers from our previous fit [16], where we made a separate background fit, and then with the background parameter Ebr2 varying within its 90% limits we further fitted the signal contributions.In the current analysis, we fit the background parameters and signal parameters simultaneously, so it gives weaker but more reasonable limits. 11  independent of the event number in the peak bin and fairly robust.
<EOS>
Finally, we note that the small change of the cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µτ [ =(cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ+ 0.178(cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ ] in the above fit mainly comes from the tension in the non-resonant bin of (1.1−1.3) TeV (which is on the left-hand-side of the peak bin).Namely, in Fig 3(a) we see that this (1.1−1.3) TeV bin is significantly below the blue curve; so reducing events in the peak bin will slightly soften the tension with this bin and thus allow more µ± (τ±) contribution.From the above analysis, we find that the evidence of the non-peak excess can stand by itself, and is fairly independent of the peak excess.
<EOS>
 When making the χ2 fit in Fig 3(b) for each given y value, we also obtain the fit values for other free parameters as functions of y, including the two cross sections.We explicitly plot the (cid:38) 9 the two fitted cross sections in Fig 3(d).From these curves, we observe that for y = yµ+ yτ µ± (τ±) decay contribution remains fairly ﬂat, and the cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e drops roughly as y−1This means that for larger values of y , the contribution from µ± (τ±) decays is already maximized, so the increase of y is mainly caused by the decrease of the e± cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105)eThe fact that the contribution of e± channel gets suppressed for large y is important for our γ ray analysis, which will be discussed in Section 4.
<EOS>
 2.5. Origin of Flavor Composition of CRE Spectrum  From the analysis in Section 2.4, we find that the original lepton final state produced at a nearby source should have a ﬂavor composition ratio, Ne : (Nµ + 0.178Nτ ) = 1 : y , with the constrained range 2.4 < y < 34.7 at 90% C.L. (Our analysis here used the current improved fit of y which diﬀers from our previous analysis [16] and is more reliable.) We note that in the above ratio, the τ component could only play a minor role due to the suppression by its small decay branching fraction Br[τ → e ¯νeντ ](cid:39) 17.82%The simplest realization of this ﬂavor composition condition is Ne : Nµ : Nτ ≈ 1 : y : 0 , where all the non-peak excesses are given by the decay contribution of muon ﬂavor. The above ﬂavor composition condition will place important constraint on the lepton- related DM model building.For instance, we can consider the typical lepton portal DM models [10, 21], where the DM particle is either a fermion or scalar.
<EOS>
For the case of fermionic DM, consider a neutral singlet Dirac fermion χ as the DM, which interacts with a scalar mediator S and the right-handed charged lepton (cid:96)Rj, Lχ ⊃ λjSj χ(cid:96)j + h.c.  (2.19)  where (cid:96)j = e, µ, τFor the case of scalar DM, consider a neutral complex singlet scalar X as the DM particle and a Dirac fermion ψ as the mediator (which has the same electric charge and lepton number as the charged leptons).The relevant interaction Lagrangian is given by  LX ⊃ λjXψj(cid:96)j + h.c.  12  (2.20)  The above interactions will realize the DM annihilation process χ ¯χ → (cid:96)j(cid:96)j or XX → (cid:96)j(cid:96)j via the t-channel exchange of Sj or ψLj.We note that the cross section of DM annihilations is proportional to λ4 jFor the above simplest realization of the ﬂavor composition condition, we can deduce Ne : Nµ : Nτ = λ4 τ = 1 : y : 0 , where the ﬂavor ratio y is constrained within 2.4 < y < 34.7 at 90% C.L. Hence, this results in a simple coupling relation, λe : λµ : 4 (cid:39) 1.2−2.4In general, including the possible decay contribution of τ λτ = 1 : y 1 leptons, we infer the following condition for DM couplings,  4 : 0 , with y 1  µ : λ4  e : λ4  (cid:18)  (cid:19)1  4  λe :  λ4 µ+  1 6  λ4 τ  = 1 : y  1 4 (2.21)  4 (cid:39) 1.2− 2.4 (90% C.L.). where the ﬂavor ratio y is confined into a rather narrow range y 1 We may consider that the lepton-DM portal sector poses a µ−τ ﬂavor symmetry and thus realizes λµ = λτThen, we can use this to derive a neat coupling relation from Eq.(2.21),  4 =(cid:0) 6 7y(cid:1) 1  λe : λµ : λτ = 1 : ˜y  (2.22) 4 (cid:39) 1.2−2.3This constraint provides important guideline for the DM model with ˜y 1 buildings.

Impacts of DAMPE Future Running  Up to the end of 2019, the DAMPE satellite had accumulated data for 4 years, and is expected to run up to 6 years or even longer.As the data size grows, the statistical errors will decrease.
<EOS>
Assuming the same central values of the detected CRE ﬂuxes, the statistical errors will scale with time as σstat∝ t−1/2.This means that the statistical errors of the 4-year  data is reduced to (cid:112)1.5/4 (cid:39) 61% of that of the released data in 2017 [8], and the 6-year measurements will reduce the statistical errors to(cid:112)1.5/6 = 50%We assume that the same  systematical errors as before. We redo the fit for the projected 6-year data taking of DAMPE, and present the results in  Fig 4(a).
<EOS>
This new fit gives  Ae = 0.106 GeV−1,  γ2 = 2.73,  γ3 = 2.27, Ebr2 = 57 GeV, Ecut = 2.46 TeV,  (2.23)  for the background parameters, together with the DM mass Mχ = 1.54 TeV, and the DM annihilation cross sections (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 1.52× 10−26cm3/s and (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µτ = 1.22× 10−25cm3/sFor the fitting quality, we have χ2/d.o.f. = 51.6/26 = 1.98The increased χ2 value of this fit is mainly due to the reduction of the statistical errors of the 6-year data taking.The ∆χ2 as a function of the ﬂavor ratio y is plotted in Fig 4(b).We obtain the ﬂavor ratio y = 8.0+3.9−3.0 (1σ) and 3.4 < y < 15.7 at 90% C.L. For the case of y = 0 , we find that χ2 increases by  13  Figure 4: Fits of DAMPE CRE spectra for projected 4-year and 6-year data taking.

 ∆χ2 = χ2(y = 0)−χ2 min = 11.1, in which the 5 red bins provide ∆χ2 = 12.4 as the dominant contribution.The reason why the total increase ∆χ2 is less than the contribution from the 5 red bins is because in certain bins the changes in ∆χ2 are negative. For comparison, we apply the same analysis to the projected 4-year DAMPE data.

Comparison with Other CRE Detections  In this section, we will extend our analysis of Section 2 to further combine the CRE mea- surement of Fermi-LAT [6] in Section 3.1, and then compare it with the recent data from AMS-02 [5] and CALET [7] in Section 3.2.  3.1. Combined Fit with Fermi-LAT  We note that the CRE measurement by Fermi-LAT [6] shows good consistency with the DAMPE result [8] even for the high energy region.We observe that the CRE spectrum of Fermi-LAT exhibits a rise around (0.6− 1.2) TeV region, which is consistent with the non- resonant excess (5 red bins) of the DAMPE result in Fig 1, and thus may hint the µ± (τ±) decay signals.Although the Fermi-LAT data do not show a clear peak-like signal around (1.3−1.5) TeV (unlike DAMPE), this is still consistent because the energy resolution of Fermi- LAT is about (10−20)% [6] above 1 TeV energy scale, and is much larger than the DAMPE energy resolution (1−2)% [8, 9].
<EOS>
 In the following, we will make a combined fit for both the DAMPE data (25 GeV−2.6 TeV) and the Fermi-LAT data with the high energy (HE) selection (42 GeV−2.1 TeV).For this, we define the total χ2 as follows,  χ2 = χ2(DAMPE) + χ2(Fermi-LAT)  (cid:34) (cid:88)  j  =  (cid:90) EuD  j  ElD  j  j − ΦD  1 σD j  ΦD e (E) j − ElD EuD  j  dE  (cid:33)(cid:35)2  + (D ↔ F) ,  (3.1)  (cid:32)  (cid:90)  where the superscript D (F) stands for DAMPE (Fermi-LAT), and the quantities Ej, El σj and Φj are the same as those defined in Eq.(2.16). The DAMPE detector has high energy resolution of (1−2)% [8, 9], so we have ΦD  e (cid:39) Φe for DAMPE data, where Φe is the original CRE ﬂux spectrum.
<EOS>
But for Fermi-LAT data, because the energy resolution is much lower than DAMPE, we should take it into account for the measured ﬂux ΦF eThe energy resolution can be described by a Gaussian distribution.For the Fermi-LAT data, we convolve Φe with this Gaussian distribution through the integral,  j, Eu j ,  e (EF) ≡ ΦF  Φe(E)  1√ 2π∆E  exp  dE ,  (3.2)  (cid:20) −(EF−E)2  (cid:21)  2∆2 E  where ∆E is the energy resolution at a given energy EThe specific values of ∆E (as a function of E) are adopted from Fig 10 of Ref. [6]. We fit the DAMPE data and Fermi-LAT data by minimizing the combined χ2.
<EOS>
The quality  of the best fit is χ2/d.o.f. = 61.0/53 (cid:39) 1.15The fit gives the background parameters,  Ae = 0.762 GeV−1,  γ2 = 3.42,  γ3 = 2.28, Ebr2 = 28 GeV, Ecut = 3.09 TeV,  (3.3)  15  Figure 5: Combined fit of CRE energy spectra for both DAMPE and Fermi-LAT data.Plot (a): The best-fit result is compared with the DAMPE data points (with error bars).Plot (b): The same best- fit result is convolved with Fermi-LAT’s energy resolution (marked as “smeared”), and is compared with the Fermi-LAT data points (with error bars).
<EOS>
Plot (c): The ∆χ2 values versus y from our fit, which gives y = 6.6+4.9−2.8 at 1σ and 2.2 < y < 18.1 at 90% C.L. as well as the DM mass Mχ = 1.54 TeV, and annihilation cross sections (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µτ = 1.07× 10−25cm3/s and (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 1.61×10−26cm3/sIn Fig 5, we present our fit of both ﬂuxes ΦD (for DAMPE data) and ΦF (for Fermi-LAT data) in the plots (a) and (b), respectively.These arise from the same fit, but due to the convolution with the energy resolution of Fermi-LAT, the shape of the curve of ΦF [plot (b)] is not identical to that of ΦD [plot (a)]. Furthermore, we plot ∆χ2 as a function the ﬂavor ratio y in Fig 5(c).
<EOS>
From this, we derive the 1σ bound on the ﬂavor ratio y = 6.6+4.9−2.8, and the 90% C.L. bound, 2.2 < y < 18.1We note that the case of y = 0 worsens the fit quality considerably, with the χ2 value increasing by 5.9This indicates again that including the µ± (τ±) decay contribution is favored by the combined data of DAMPE and Fermi-LAT. Finally, for comparison, we summarize in Table 2 our fits of the CRE energy spectra for the current DAMPE data, the projected 4-year and 6-year running of DAMPE, and the combined data set of DAMPE+Fermi-LAT. 16  bkg+decay+peakbkg+decaybkgonly●decaybin■peakbin◆bkgbin105010050010005000050100150200250Ee[GeV]Ee3Φe[m-2s-1sr-1GeV2](a)DAMPE+FermiLATFitbkg+decay+peakbkg+decaybkgonly●FermiLAT-bkgbins●FermiLAT-decaybins●FermiLAT-peakbins105010050010005000050100150200250Ee[GeV]Ee3Φe[m-2s-1sr-1GeV2](b)DAMPE+FermiLATFit(smeared)0510152001234yΔχ2(c)DAMPE+FermiLATFitExperiments  χ2/d.o.f  Mχ (TeV)  DAMPE  19.6/26=0.756  DAMPE (in 4y)  39.6/26=1.52  DAMPE (in 6y)  51.6/26=1.98  DAMPE+Fermi-LAT  61.0/53=1.15  1.54  1.54  1.54  1.54  (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e 0.154  0.153  0.152  0.161  (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µτ 1.39  1.28  1.22  1.07  y  9.0+8.4−4.2 8.4+4.6−3.3 8.0+3.9−3.0 6.6+4.9−2.8  Table 2: Comparison of the fitting results for DAMPE and Fermi-LAT experiments.

Comparison with AMS-02 and CALET  In this subsection, we will further compare our DAMPE analysis (Section 2) with the  AMS-02 and CALET data.
<EOS>
 The CALET collaboration gave a recent update of its CRE measurement over the energy range (0.011−4.8)TeV in June, 2018 [7].The CRE spectrum of CALET is consistent with a break at 0.9 TeV (as found by the DAMPE observation [8]).The CALET data do not show a peak structure around (1.3−1.5) TeV, but it is premature to draw any firm conclusion since CALET still has sizable statistical uncertainties beyond 1 TeV energy.
<EOS>
The AMS collaboration published new precision measurements of cosmic ray electrons up to 1.4 TeV in March, 2019 [5].Together with their positron measurement published in January, 2019, the CRE spectrum of AMS-02 shows agreement with the CALET result [7] up to 1 TeV.However, this measurement does not reach the energy region of the peak excess shown by DAMPE data.
<EOS>
We can hardly compare the non-peak excess of DAMPE with the AMS-02 result as well, because the latter only shows two data points over the energy region (0.6 − 1.1) TeV. In view of the current situation discussed above, we need not to fit all the DM parameters with the AMS-02 and CALET data in this subsection.Instead, we will just test a few bench- mark cases motivated by our analysis in Section 2.4. We combine the CALET data (using the same energy binning as DAMPE analysis) with the AMS-02 data (electron + positron), and apply the χ2 fit to the following three cases: (a).
<EOS>
There is only background CRE ﬂux without assuming any e± signals from the DM  annihilation. (b).There exist e± signals from the DM annihilations, with the DM mass Mχ = 1.535 TeV, the annihilation cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 1.54×10−26cm3/s and the ﬂavor ratio y = 9.0 as given by the best fit of Section 2.4.  (c).
<EOS>
Same as Case-(b), but the DM mass is allowed to vary within the range Mχ∈ [1.7, 1.9] TeV. 17  Figure 6: Combined fit of the CRE energy spectra from AMS-02 and CALET.In each plot, the AMS-02 (CALET) data are shown as green (black) dots, including their 1σ error bars.

Plot (a): The best fit without DM contribution, defined as Case-(a) in the text, with χ2/d.o.f. = 36.32/64 = 0.567.Plot (b): The best fit of CALET in Case-(b) with χ2/d.o.f. = 43.95/61 = 0.721, where we input the best-fit of the ﬂavor ratio y from DAMPE data as in Section 2.4. Plot (c): The best fit of Case- (c) which includes the DM mass for fit and gives Mχ = 1.745 TeV.The corresponding fit quality, χ2/d.o.f. = 37.39/61 = 0.613, is comparable to Case-(a).
<EOS>
 For the above three cases, our fits have the fit quality  χ2/d.o.f. = (36.32/64, 43.95/61, 37.39/61) (cid:39) (0.567, 0.721, 0.613),  (3.4)  respectively.Also, the fit of Case-(c) gives the DM mass Mχ = 1.745 TeV.We see that adding the dark matter contribution does not aﬀect much the fitting quality.
<EOS>
We present the fitted CRE energy spectra for the three cases in plots (a)-(c) of Fig 6. Inspecting the CALET CRE spectrum alone, we note that there apppear two broad ex- cesses around the windows (0.75− 1.2) TeV and (1.5− 2.0) TeV.The first one is not only compatible with AMS-02 data, but also coincide with the non-peak excess range of DAMPE as we uncovered in Fig 1 (the 5 red bins).
<EOS>
The second excess is around the energy window somewhat higher than the peak excess of DAMPE (the blue bin in Fig 1), but our fit shows  18  fittedcurve(w/oDM)●AMS-02data●CALETdata105010050010005000050100150200250Ee[GeV]Ee3Φe[m-2s-1sr-1GeV2](a)AMS-02+CALETFitbkg+decay+peakbkg+decaybkgonly●AMS-02data●CALETdata105010050010005000050100150200250Ee[GeV]Ee3Φe[m-2s-1sr-1GeV2](b)AMS-02+CALETFitbkg+decay+peakbkg+decaybkgonly●AMS-02data●CALETdata105010050010005000050100150200250Ee[GeV]Ee3Φe[m-2s-1sr-1GeV2](c)AMS-02+CALETFitFigure 7: Final state radiation (FSR) spectra for e±, µ± and τ± (with 1.54 TeV energy), shown as (blue, black, red) curves, respectively.The τ± channel (red curve) dominates the sub-TeV region, so its fraction will be strongly constrained. that it can match a peak structure from the DM signals with mass Mχ = 1.745 TeV.
<EOS>
 The current CRE spectra of DAMPE and CALET data show some diﬀerent features, especially at energies around 1.5 TeV, which are yet to be resolved after collecting much larger data samples in the near future.But such diﬀerences are not significant given the much larger error bars of CALET data at energies above 1 TeV.Regardless of the unknown systematic eﬀects, our above analysis still shows some compatible spectral features between these experimental data, which may be the hint of certain dark matter annihilation processes nearby and are worth of attention.
<EOS>
Hence, the upcoming data of the on-going DAMPE and CALET measurements will be extremely helpful. 4.Gamma Ray Constraints from Fermi-LAT  In this section, we analyze constraints on the DM annihilation signals from the γ-ray mea- surements of Fermi-LAT.
<EOS>
There have been some discussions on possible constraints from the γ-ray observations [26].Most of the literatures assumed point-like sources of the γ-ray emis- sion from the nearby subhalo.But such a nearby subhalo is in fact a largely extended object, so more dedicated search and analysis are necessary.
<EOS>
The γ-rays produced by the leptons from DM annihilations consist of two main components, the prompt γ-rays and the secondary γ- rays.The former are emitted during the DM annihilations, including the final state radiation and photons from the hadronic decays of τ leptons.The latter case is the secondary emission, mainly due to the Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) emission of electrons/positrons when propagating in the interstellar radiation field.
<EOS>
For the nearby subhalo scenario considered in the present study, the ICS γ-rays are less than 1% and thus negligible as compared to the prompt γ-rays [26].Thus, we will focus on the prompt γ-rays in this analysis. 19  e±μ±τ±10501005001000050100150200250300Ee[GeV]Ee2dN/dEe[GeV]FSRSpectraAngular Radius θ0  0.1◦  1.0◦  10◦  Integrated J Factor (1020 GeV2cm−5) Averaged J Factor (1025 GeV2cm−5sr−1)  2.819  146.5  3138  2.946  1.531  0.3288  Table 3: Typical values of the integrated and averaged J factors.

 4.1. Prompt Gamma Rays  We apply the PPPC4DMID code [23] to compute the energy spectra of the prompt photon emissions, as shown in Fig 7.The τ± channel significantly diﬀers from that of the e± and µ± channels, because of the π0 products from τ± decays.For the e± and µ± channels, the final state radiation (FSR) comes from the internal bremsstrahlung radiation only.
<EOS>
In Sections 2 and 3, we have determined the value of the ﬂavor ratio y , which is a combination of the µ± fraction and the τ± fraction, through fitting to the CRE data.The γ-ray data are expected to give further constraints on the τ± fraction due to its abundant photon production. 4.2. The J factor  The expected photon ﬂux from the DM annihilations in a nearby subhalo is given by  In the above, the J factor is defined as  J(θ) =  ds ρ2  χ(r) ,  distance from a point on l.o.s. to the subhalo center, and s =(cid:112)r2+ d2  where θ is the angle between the line-of-sight (l.o.s.) and the subhalo center, r is the radial s− 2rdscos θ is the l.o.s.  l.o.s.  distance to the observer.

 For convenience, we fit the distribution of lnJ as a function of ln θ, and obtain  ln[J(θ)] = C − 0.479507 ln θ − 0.12386(ln θ)2 − 0.0265383(ln θ)3,  (4.3) where J is in unit of 1020 GeV2cm−5 and θ is in unit of degrees.The constant C is irrelevant here, since we are going to use a normalized skymap in the data analysis.The error of this parametrization as compared to the numerical integral of Eq.(4.2) is less than 2.5% for the angular range θ < 20◦.

 We present in Fig 8 the skymap of the normalized J factor distribution of the subhalo in a 40◦×40◦ region, which will be used in the analysis of Fermi-LAT data in the next subsection.

Gamma Ray Searches with Fermi-LAT  We use the Pass 8 data recorded by Fermi-LAT between August 4, 2008 and July 2, 2018 to search for possible γ-ray emission from such a DM subhalo.We restrict our study with the CLEAN event class (evclass = 256 and evtype = 3).
<EOS>
To reduce the impact from the Earth limb, the events with zenith angles > 90◦ are excluded.We perform the searches (in a series of sky di- rections) within regions of interest (ROIs) centered at galactic coordinates ((cid:96), b) = (0◦, ±90◦), (0◦, ±70◦), (90◦, ±70◦), (180◦, ±70◦), (270◦, ±70◦), (0◦, 0◦), (0◦, 30◦), and (120◦, 45◦), re- spectively.The ROI radius is chosen to be 20◦.
<EOS>
For most of ROIs, the energy range is chosen as 100 MeV−500 GeV.Since the expected signal appears mainly in the high energy band, we perform the analysis in the range (1−500) GeV for ROIs (0◦, 30◦) and (120◦, 45◦), and the range (10−500) GeV for the ROI (0◦, 0◦), in order to speed up the analysis.For the (0◦, 0◦) case, a higher energy threshold can also reduce the impact from the reported Galactic center GeV γ-ray excesses [27].
<EOS>
 We use the standard binned likelihood method with the science tool version v10r0p5.2 The model includes point sources from the 3FGL catalog [28], the diﬀuse background templates gll iem v06 and iso P8R2 CLEAN V6 v06,3 as well as our postulated DM subhalo.If no clear signal is found, the 95% confidence upper limits (UL) on the annihilation cross section are derived (cf.Appendix A for detail).
<EOS>
The mass of the DM particle is fixed to be Mχ= 1.54 TeV.We study the following benchmark cases for the DM annihilation: (a). (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = 0, which corresponds to background only; (b). (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = free, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = 0 ; 2http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/software/ 3http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/BackgroundModels.html  21  (c). (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = free, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = 0 ; (d). (cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = free, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = 0 ; (e). (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = free, which corresponds to Ne : Nµ : Nτ = 1 : 1 : 1 ; (f). (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 1.54×10−26cm3/s, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = free, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = 0 ; (g). (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 1.54×10−26cm3/s, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = 0, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = free ; (h). (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 1.54×10−26cm3/s, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = free, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = free ; (i). (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 1.54×10−26cm3/s, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ = free, (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ = 1.39×10−25cm3/s − 0.178(cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ , which  corresponds to y ≡ 9.0 Here the Cases (a)-(e) are generic fits, and the rest of cases are more or less motivated by our fits to the DAMPE CRE data.For illustration, we summarize the fitting results for ROIs (0◦, 30◦) and (90◦, 70◦) in Table 4, where we define the diﬀerence of log-likelihoods for a given Case-(j) as  −∆lnLj = ln[L(background)] − ln[L(Case-j)] (4.4) Note that a negative value of −∆lnLj indicates a better fitting quality than the background- only fit (corresponding to the Case-(a)).
<EOS>
Further discussions are given in Appendix A. The full results of all the ROIs are summarized in Appendix B.  We find that in general there lacks any DM signal from the selected ROIs.The corre- sponding upper limits (ULs) on the thermally averaged annihilation cross sections are derived to be about (0.1−1)×10−25 cm3 s−1 for the e± and µ± channels, and 1−2 orders of magnitude stronger for τ± channel.These limits depend on the directions of the sky regions which have diﬀerent background intensities.
<EOS>
The weakest constraints come from the direction towards the Galactic center region, where the backgrounds are the highest.For instance, when the DM subhalo is located at high galactic latitude such as the ROI (90◦, 70◦), the existence of such a DM subhalo may be marginally constrained by the data.On the other hand, when the DM subhalo sits at low galactic latitudes such as the ROI (0◦, 30◦), we see that the annihila- tion channels χχ→ e+e−, µ+µ− are still allowed, but as expected, the channel χχ→ τ +τ− is strongly constrained.
<EOS>
 The Cases (f)-(h) which can potentially explain the peak excesses of the DAMPE measure- ment are generally consistent with the Fermi-LAT data.Only in a few ROIs the inclusion of such a DM component leads to slight tension with the data (−∆lnL (cid:46) 3.5 ).The Case-(i) is proposed to explain both the peak excess around 1.4 TeV and the non-peak feature below 1 TeV, which can be further constrained by the Fermi-LAT data.
<EOS>
But, when the subhalo is located in low galactic latitude regions (such as b < 30◦), this case is also consistent with the Fermi-LAT data.Whenever τ± channel is open, it is shown that the τ± fraction in the DM annihilation final states is severely constrained.This also provides important guideline for the DM model building.

Constraints on τ± Fraction  In this subsection we consider the ﬂavor ratios yµ = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)µ/(cid:104)σv(cid:105)e and yτ = 0.178(cid:104)σv(cid:105)τ /(cid:104)σv(cid:105)e.
<EOS>
We scan the parameter space of the full plane of yµ− yτ to further pin down the viable region for the ﬂavor ratios in certain ROIs. In Fig 9(a), we plot the result in the ROI with ((cid:96), b) = (0◦, 30◦).We scan the values of (yµ, yτ ) in the regions yµ ∈ [0, 20] and yτ ∈ [0, 0.20].
<EOS>
As for the cross sections, we apply the fit relation for ytotal versus (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e as in Fig 3(d), rather than using the fixed value (cid:104)σv(cid:105)e = 1.54×10−26cm3/sFor the Fermi-LAT data, the χ2 function is defined as χ2(yµ, yτ ) = −2lnL , and ∆χ2 is the variation from its best fit point.In Fig 9(a), we present the allowed regions by the γ-ray data of Fermi-LAT, in the (yµ, yτ ) plane at 68% (red region) and 90% (pink region) confidence limits.In the same (yµ, yτ ) plane, we present the DAMPE constraints from Fig 3(b) as the blue region (light blue region) at 68% (90%) confidence limit.
<EOS>
We see that for  23  Figure 9: Allowed regions in the plane of ﬂavor ratios yµ− yτIn each plot, the red region (pink region) are allowed by the γ-ray constraints of Fermi-LAT at 68% (90%) confidence limit, while the blue region (light blue region) are allowed by the DAMPE constraints at 68% (90%) confidence limit.Plot-(a) is for the ROI centered in ((cid:96), b) = (0◦, 30◦) and plot-(b) is for the ROI centered in ((cid:96), b) = (90◦, 70◦). yτ = 0.035, the case of Ne : Nµ : Nτ (cid:39) 1 : 9.0 : 0.2 is fully allowed at 90% C.L. in this ROI.
<EOS>
For the lepton portal DM models discussed in Section 2.5, this corresponds to the coupling relation, λe : λµ : λτ (cid:39) 1 : 1.7 : 0.7 Note that as explained in Fig 3(d) and Section 2.4, for a large ratio y , the combined contribution from the µ± (τ±) channels does not vary much as y increases, but the fraction of e± channel will drop.Thus, the total γ-ray ﬂux from e± channel will decrease, which allows more τ± contribution.This is why for the 90% C.L. contour of Fermi-LAT in Fig 9(a), the τ± (cid:38) 10We see that in the ROI with ((cid:96), b) = (0◦, 30◦), the fraction rises up in the region of yµ 90% C.L. pink region allowed by the Fermi-LAT γ-ray constraint has significant overlap with that of the DAMPE CRE constraint.
<EOS>
 For comparison, we further show the contour plot in Fig 9(b) for the ROI with ((cid:96), b) = (90◦, 70◦).It shows that in this case the Fermi-LAT γ-ray constraint is so strong that the DM subhalo scenario in this ROI is already excluded at the 90% C.L.  5.Conclusions  Detecting signals of TeV energy CREs has been an exciting frontier for many experimental activities in recent years [3]-[8].
<EOS>
These provide important means for probing the nearby galactic sources and the possible annihilations or decays of DM particles. In Section 2, extending our previous work [16], we performed a systematically improved analysis of the DAMPE CRE data, with focus on the new hidden excess of non-peak structure over the energy range (0.6 − 1.1) TeV (red bins in Fig 1), in connection to the peak excess  24  DAMPEFermiLAT051015200.000.050.100.15yμyτ(a)(l,b)=(0°,30°)90%C.L.68%C.L.y=9.0DAMPEFermiLAT051015200.000.050.100.15yμyτ(b)(l,b)=(90°,70°)90%C.L.y=9.0around (1.3−1.5) TeV (blue bin in Fig 1).We explain this new non-peak excess and the peak excess from the 1.5 TeV µ± (τ±) events and the 1.5 TeV e± events which are produced together from DM annihilations in a nearby subhalo, with the subsequent 3-body decays of µ± (τ±) into e± plus neutrinos (Fig.
<EOS>
2).We made an improved analysis of the CRE physical backgrounds which consist of CRE ﬂuxes from SNR and ISM.Then, we systematically analyzed the CRE spectra from the DM annihilations including the final state photon radiations (which soften the CRE spectra), as shown in Fig 2.
<EOS>
Our improved fit analysis demonstrates that the ﬂavor structure of the original lepton final-state of DM annihilations in a nearby subhalo or clump should have a ﬂavor composition ratio Ne : (Nµ + 0.178Nτ ) = 1 : y with y = 9.0+8.4−4.2 (1σ bound) and 2.4 < y < 34.7 (90% C.L.) for the current DAMPE data, as shown in Fig 3.Using this new fit, we analyzed the lepton-portal DM models and deduced a bound on the 4 (cid:39) 1.2− 2.4lepton-DM-mediator couplings λe : (λ4 Such constraints are important for DM model buildings.We further analyzed the improved sensitivities from the projected 4-year and 6-year runnings of DAMPE detector, as presented in Fig 4.
<EOS>
We found that assuming the current central values of the CRE spectrum, the DAMPE 6-year running will constrain the lepton ﬂavor ratio to y = 8.0+3.9−3.0 at 1σ level and 3.4 < y < 15.7 at 90% C.L., while the bounds from the 4-year running give y = 8.4+4.6−3.3 at 1σ level and 3.3 < y < 18.2 at 90% C.L.  4 with a narrow range y 1  4 = 1 : y 1  µ + 1  6λ4  τ ) 1  In Section 3, extending our analysis of Section 2, we further combined with the CRE mea- surement of Fermi-LAT [6], and then compare with the recent data from AMS-02 [5] and CALET [7].We found that the new non-peak excess of DAMPE is consistent with the Fermi- LAT data [6].The absence of the peak excess (∼1.4 TeV) at Fermi-LAT may be due to its much lower energy resolution above 1 TeV scale.
<EOS>
Our combined fit of the DAMPE and Fermi- LAT spectra is presented in Fig 5 and constrains the ﬂavor ratio as y = 6.6+4.9−2.8 at 1σ level and 2.2 < y < 18.1 at 90% C.L. On the other hand, the data of AMS-02 [5] and CALET [7] show more diﬀerences from DAMPE, especially for the high energy range E > 500 GeV.Nev- ertheless, we observe that the CALET CRE spectrum shows two broad excesses around the energy windows (0.75− 1.2) TeV and (1.5− 2.0) TeV, although their statistical uncertainties are still rather sizable.The first excess is compatible with the non-peak excess of DAMPE and the second excess lies at energies somewhat higher than the DAMPE peak excess.
<EOS>
By inputting the DM mass Mχ= 1.78 TeV and using the DM cross sections from our best fit of DAMPE data, we can still fit the CALET data with good quality (Fig.6).As compared to the pure background fit, the total χ2 only has a minor rise ∆χ2 = 1.59 In Section 4, we further analyzed the γ-ray measurements of Fermi-LAT and derived new constraints on the ﬂuxes of diﬀerent final state leptons from the DM annihilations.
<EOS>
Our analysis considered for the first time the spatial extension of the γ-ray emission from the subhalo (Fig.8).We showed in Tables 4-8 that the existence of such a nearby DM subhalo  25  at high galactic latitude is within the sensitivity reach of Fermi-LAT, although no significant γ-ray signals show up yet.
<EOS>
For the low galactic latitude regions such as the ROI centering at ((cid:96), b) = (0◦, 30◦), we found in Tables 4 and 8 that the DM annihilation channels χχ → e+e−, µ+µ− are still viable, while the channel χχ → τ +τ− is subject to a strong constraint.We presented the Fermi-LAT constraints together with the DAMPE CRE fit on the ﬂavor ratios (yµ, yτ ) in Figs.9(a) and 9(b) for two sample ROIs with low and high galactic latitudes.
<EOS>
In the ROI centered at ((cid:96), b) = (0◦, 30◦), Fig 9(a) shows that the range of the ﬂavor ratio (cid:46) 0.035 is always allowed by the Fermi-LAT γ-ray data.For instance, the ﬂavor ratios yτ (yµ, yτ ) = (9.0, 0.035) present a viable realization, which correspond to Ne : Nµ : Nτ (cid:39) 1 : 9.0 : 0.2 and thus the ratio of DM-lepton-mediator couplings λe : λµ : λτ (cid:39) 1 : 1.7 : 0.7Such constraints give important guideline for the lepton-portal type of DM model buildings. Our current study shows that the non-peak new excess around (0.6− 1.1) TeV and the tentative 1.4 TeV peak structure in the DAMPE CRE spectrum provide encouraging clues to the possible new physics related to DM annihilations (decays) and the ﬂavor composition of the final state leptons.
<EOS>
These deserve further investigations.The future high energy CRE measurements are important to further pin down these new excesses.

Likelihood and Upper Limits for the γ-Ray Analysis  The log-likelihood function of the model parameter set p is given by the Possion probability  (cid:88)  lnL(p) =  (njln ej− ej− ln nj!) ,  (A.1)  j  where nj is the observed number of photons in a given energy and spatial bin, and ej is the expected number of photons in the same bin given the model parameters.The subscript j runs over all energy and spatial bins.
<EOS>
In our analysis, the paremeter set p includes all the background parameters (i.e., spectral parameters of point sources in the ROI and the normalizations of the diﬀuse backgrounds), the cross section and/or the branching fraction of the DM annihilation.We adopt the profile likelihood method to deal with the background parameters [29]. In case that no signal is found, we derive the upper limits on the DM annihilation cross sections.
<EOS>
The 95% upper limit for one-parameter fit is derived by setting −∆lnL = lnL((cid:104)σv(cid:105)= 0)−lnL((cid:104)σv(cid:105)) < 1.35For the Case-(h) which has two free parameters of the DM annihilation, the 95% C.L. upper limit is defined by −∆lnL < 2.30 B. Summary of γ-ray Fitting Results for All ROIs  In this Appendix, we summarize the fitting results in all ROIs, in addition to Table 4 as presented in Section 4.3. In each table, the columns from left to right correspond to the model ﬂags, −∆ lnL, best-fit and 95% upper limit (UL) of the cross sections (in units of 10−25cm3 s−1) for each channel. From Tables 5-7, we see that at high latitudes with b (cid:62) 70◦, the Fermi-LAT γ-ray data not only show null results for the DM annihilation signal at its best fits, but also exclude our model motivated by the DAMPE data at 95% C.L.  On the other hand, in the ROIs at low latitudes with b(cid:54) 30◦, we find that our proposed DM subhalo is allowed by the constraints of the 10-year γ-ray data from Fermi-LAT experiment, although no significant signals show up yet.But in this case, we can derive an upper bound on the ﬂavor ratio of τ±.
