<EOS>
b'(2019) and Zhang & Lee (2019) incorporate permutation loss instead of displacement loss in (Zan\xef\xac\x81r\n& Sminchisescu, 2018), with notable improvement across both synthetic and real data.Note that Eq.(1) involves both node and edge information, which exactly correspond to the diag-\nonal and off-diagonal elements in K, respectively.'
<EOS>
b'Edges can carry informative multi-dimensional\nattributes (namely weights) which are fundamental to graph matching.However existing embed-\nding based graph matching methods (Wang et al., 2019;Xu et al., 2019) are focused on the explicit\nmodeling of node level features, whereby the edges are only used as topological node connection for\nmessage passing in GCN.'
<EOS>
b'Besides, edge attributes are neither well modeled in the embedding-free\nmodel (Zan\xef\xac\x81r & Sminchisescu, 2018)since the edge information is derived from the concatena-\ntion of node features.To our best knowledge, there is no deep graph matching method explicitly\nincorporating edge attributes.'
<EOS>

<EOS>
b'There are mainly two forms in\nexisting deep graph matching works: i) displacement loss (Zan\xef\xac\x81r & Sminchisescu, 2018) similar tothe use in optical \xef\xac\x82ow estimation (Ren et al., 2017); ii)'
<EOS>
b'the so-called permutation loss (Wang et al.,\n2019) involving iterative Sinkhorn procedure followed by a cross-entropy loss.Results in (Wang\net al., 2019) show the latter is an effective improvement against the former regression based loss.However, we argue that the continuous Sinkhorn procedure (in training stage) is yet an unnatural\napproximation to Hungarian sampling (in testing stage) for discretization.'
<EOS>
b'If the network is equipped\nwith a continuous loss function (e.g. cross-entropy), we argue that the training process will make a\ngreat \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningless effort\xe2\x80\x9d to enforce some network output digits of the \xef\xac\x81nal matching matrix into\nbinary and neglect the resting digits which might have notable impact on accuracy.This paper strikes an endeavor on the above two gaps and makes the following main contributions:\n\ni)We propose a new approach for edge embedding via channel-wise operation, namely channel-'

b'independent embedding (CIE).The hope is to effectively explore the edge attribute and simulate\nthe multi-head strategy in attention models (Veli\xcb\x87ckovi\xc2\xb4c et al., 2018) by decoupling the calculations\nparallel and orthogonal to channel direction.In fact, edge attribute information has not been consid-\nered in existing embedding based graph matching methods (Wang et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019).'
<EOS>
b'ii)We devise a new mechanism to adjust the loss function based on the Hungarian method which is\nwidely used for linear assignment problem, as termed by Hungarian attention.It resorts to dynami-\ncally generating sparse matching mask according to Hungarian sampling during training, rather than\napproximating Hungarian sampling with a differentiable function.'
<EOS>
b'As such, the Hungarian attention\nintroduces higher smoothness against traditional loss functions to ease the training.iii)The empirical results on three public benchmarks shows that the two proposed techniques are\northogonal and bene\xef\xac\x81cial to existing techniques.'
<EOS>
b'Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, on the one hand, our CIE module\ncan effectively boost the accuracy by exploring the edge attributes which otherwise are not consid-ered in state-of-the-art deep graph matching methods; on the other hand, our Hungarian attention\nmechanism also shows generality and it is complementary to existing graph matching loss.2'

<EOS>
b'The learning procedure is explicitly derived from the factorization of af\xef\xac\x81nity\nmatrix (Zhou & De la Torre, 2012), which makes the interpretation of the network behavior possible.However, the displacement loss in (Zan\xef\xac\x81r & Sminchisescu, 2018) measures the pixel-wise transla-\ntion which is similar to optical-\xef\xac\x82ow(Dosovitskiy et al., 2015), being essentially a regression task\ninstead of combinaotiral optimization.'

<EOS>
b'For most graph matching algorithms, the output is in a continuous domain.Though there are some\nalternatives that deliver discrete solutions by adding more constraints or introducing numerical con-\ntinuation (Zhou & De la Torre, 2012; Yu et al., 2018), the main line of methods is to incorporate a\nsampling procedure (e.g. winner-take-all and Hungarian).Among them, the Hungarian algorithm\n(Kuhn, 1955) is a widely adopted, for its ef\xef\xac\x81ciency and theoretical optimality.'
<EOS>
b'However, the Hungarian algorithm incurs a gap between training (loss function) and testing stages\n(Hungarian sampling).We compare the permutation loss (Wang et al., 2019) for concrete analysis:\n\nLCE= \xe2\x88\x92'

<EOS>
b'Note Eq.(12) is an element-wise version of binary cross-entropy.During training, this loss tends\nto drag the digits in S into binary format and is likely trapped to local optima.'
<EOS>
b'This is because this\nloss will back-propagate the gradients of training samples that are easy to learn in the early training\nstage.In later iterations, this loss is then hard to give up the digits that have become binary.In fact,\nthe similar phenomenon is also investigated in the focal loss (Lin et al., 2017) in comparison to the\ntraditional cross-entropy loss.'
<EOS>
b'During the testing stage, however, the Hungarian algorithm has no\npreference on the case if digits in S are close to 0 \xe2\x88\x92 1 or not.It binarizes S anyway.Therefore, the\neffort of Eq.'

Since P-loss is naturally not as robust as D-loss on symmetric objects, P-loss showed\ngreat degradation over D-loss on \xe2\x80\x9ctable\xe2\x80\x9d (as discussed in (Wang et al., 2019)).However, with the\nhelp of Hungarian link, H-loss can maintain relatively high accuracy despite natural \xef\xac\x82aw of P-loss.'

<EOS>
b'We have presented a novel and effective approach for learning based graph matching.On one hand,\nthe novelty of our method partially lies in the development of the Hungarian attention, which in-\ntrinsically adapts the matching problem.It is further observed from the experiments that Hungarian\nattention can improve several matching-oriented loss functions, which might bring about potential\nfor a series of combinatorial problems.'
<EOS>
b'On the other hand, we also devise the channel independent\nembedding (CIE) technique for deep graph matching, which decouples the basic merging opera-\ntions and is shown robust in learning effective graph representation.Extensive experimental results\non multiple matching benchmarks show the leading performance of our solver, and highlight the\northogonal contribution of the two proposed components on top of existing techniques.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS'
