<EOS>
b'While many existing works focus on QG from\nimages (Fan et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018) or knowledge bases (Serban et al., 2016;Elsahar et al.,\n2018), in this work, we focus on QG from text.'
<EOS>
b'Conventional methods (Mostow & Chen, 2009; Heilman & Smith, 2010; Heilman, 2011) for QG rely\non heuristic rules or hand-crafted templates, leading to the issues of low generalizability andscal-ability.'
<EOS>
b'Recent attempts have been focused on exploiting Neural Network (NN)based approachesthat do not require manually-designed rules and are end-to-end trainable.'
<EOS>
b'Encouraged by the huge\nsuccess of neural machine translation, these approaches formulate the QG task as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning problem.Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, attention-based Seq2Seq models (Bahdanau\net al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015) and their enhanced versions with copy (Vinyals et al., 2015; Gu\net al., 2016) and coverage'
<EOS>
b'(Tu et al., 2016)mechanisms have been widely applied and show promis-ing results on this task (Du et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018a; Kumar et al., 2018a).'
<EOS>
b'However, these methods typically ignore the hidden structural information associated with a word\nsequence such as the syntactic parsing tree.Failing to utilize the rich text structure information\nbeyond the simple word sequence may limit the effectiveness of these models for QG.It has been observed that in general, cross-entropy based sequence training has several limitations\nlike exposure bias and inconsistency between train/test measurement'
<EOS>
b'(Ranzato et al., 2015;Wu\net al., 2016).As a result, they do not always produce the best results on discrete evaluation metrics\non sequence generation tasks such as text summerization'
<EOS>
b'(Paulus et al., 2017) or questiongener-ation (Song et al., 2017).'
<EOS>
b'To cope with these issues, some recent QG approaches (Song et al.,\n2017; Kumar et al., 2018b) directly optimize evaluation metrics using Reinforcement Learning1Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020'
<EOS>
b'(RL)(Williams, 1992).However, existing approaches usually only employ evaluation metrics like\nBLEU and ROUGE-L as rewards for RL optimization.'
<EOS>
b'More importantly, they fail to exploit other\nimportant metrics such as syntactic and semantic constraints for guiding high-quality text genera-\ntion.Early works on neural QG did not take into account the answer information when generating a\nquestion.Recent works have started to explore various means of utilizing the answer information.'
<EOS>
b'When question generation is guided by the semantics of an answer, the resulting questions become\nmore relevant and readable.Conceptually, there are three different ways to incorporate the answer\ninformation by simply marking the answer location in the passage(Zhou et al., 2017; Zhao et al.,\n2018; Liu et al., 2019), or using complex passage-answer matching strategies'
<EOS>
b'(Song et al., 2017),\nor separating answers from passages when applying a Seq2Seq model (Kim et al., 2018; Sun et al.,\n2018).However, they neglect potential semantic relations between passage words and answer words,\nand thus fail to explicitly model the global interactions among them in the embedding space.To address these aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present a novel reinforcement learning\nbased generator-evaluator architecture that aims to: i) make full use of rich hidden structure'
<EOS>
b'in-formation beyond the simple word sequence; ii) generate syntactically and semantically valid textwhile maintaining the consistency of train/test measurement; iii) model explicitly'
<EOS>
b'the global interac-\ntions of semantic relationships between passage and answer at both word-level and contextual-level.In particular, to achieve the \xef\xac\x81rst goal, we \xef\xac\x81rst explore two different means to either construct a\nsyntax-based static graph or a semantics-aware dynamic graph from the text sequence, as well as its\nrich hidden structure information.Then, we design a graph-to-sequence (Graph2Seq) model based\ngenerator that encodes the graph representation of a text passage and decodes a question sequence\nusing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).'
<EOS>
b'Our Graph2Seq model is based on a novel bidirectional\ngated graph neural network, which extends the original gated graph neural network (Li et al., 2015)by considering both incoming and outgoing edges, and fusing them during the graph embedding\nlearning.To achieve the second goal, we design a hybrid evaluator which is trained by optimizing\na mixed objective function that combines both cross-entropy and RL loss.'
<EOS>
b'We use not only discrete\nevaluation metrics like BLEU, but also semantic metrics like word mover\xe2\x80\x99s distance (Kusner et al.,\n2015) to encourage both syntactically and semantically valid text generation.To achieve the third\ngoal, we propose a novel Deep Alignment Network (DAN) for effectively incorporating answer\ninformation into the passage at multiple granularity levels.Our main contributions are as follows:'

b'While RNNs are good at capturing local dependencies among consecutive words in text, GNNs\nhave been shown to better utilize the rich hidden text structure information such as syntactic parsing(Xu et al., 2018b) or semantic parsing (Song et al., 2018b), and can model the global interactions\n(relations) among sequence words to further improve the representations.Therefore, unlike most of\nthe existing methods that rely on RNNs to encode the input passage, we \xef\xac\x81rst construct a passage\ngraph G from text where each passage word is treated as a graph node, and then employ a novel\nGraph2Seq model to encode the passage graph (and answer), and to decode the natural language\nquestion.'

b'(Xu et al., 2018b), there is no clear an-swer as to the best way of representing text as a graph.We explore both static and dynamic graph\nconstruction approaches, and systematically investigate the performance differences between these\ntwo methods in the experimental section.'

b'However, one of key difference between our BiGGNN and their bidi-rectional GraphSAGE is that we fuse the intermediate node embeddings from both incoming andoutgoing edges in every iteration during the training, whereas their model simply trains the node\nembeddings of each direction independently and concatenates them in the \xef\xac\x81nal step.'

<EOS>
b'To tackle these issues, some recent QG ap-\nproaches (Song et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2018b)directly optimize evaluation metrics using REIN-\nFORCE.We further use a mixed objective function with both syntactic and semantic constraints for\nguiding text generation.'

<EOS>
b'Initially, BLEU-4 and METEOR were designed for evaluating machine translation systems and\nROUGE-L was designed for evaluating text summarization systems.Recently, Q-BLEU1 was de-signed for better evaluating question generation systems, which was shown to correlate signi\xef\xac\x81cantly\nbetter with human judgments compared to existing metrics.'

b'Besides automatic evaluation metrics, we also conduct a human evaluation study on split-2.We ask\nhuman evaluators to rate generated questions from a set of anonymized competing systems based\non whether they are syntactically correct, semantically correct and relevant to the passage.The\nrating scale is from 1 to 5, on each of the three categories.'

<EOS>
b'On the one hand, an advantage of static graph construc-\ntion is that useful domain knowledge can be hard-coded into the graph, which can greatly bene\xef\xac\x81t the\ndownstream task.However, it might suffer if there is a lack of prior knowledge for a speci\xef\xac\x81c domain\nknowledge.On the other hand, dynamic graph construction does not need any prior knowledge\nabout the hidden structure of text, and only relies on the attention matrix to capture these structured\ninformation, which provides an easy way to achieve a decent performance.'
<EOS>
b'One interesting direction\nis to explore effective ways of combining both static and dynamic graphs.8Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020'
<EOS>
b'By turning off the Deep Alignment Network (DAN), the BLEU-4 score of G2Ssta (similarly for\nG2Sdyn) dramatically drops from 16.96% to 12.62%, which indicates the importance of answer\ninformation for QG and shows the effectiveness of DAN.This can also be veri\xef\xac\x81ed by comparing the\nperformance between the DAN-enhanced Seq2Seq model (16.14 BLEU-4 score) and other carefully\ndesigned answer-aware Seq2Seq baselines such as NQG++ (13.29 BLEU-4 score), MPQG+R (14.71\nBLEU-4 score) and AFPQA (15.82 BLEU-4 score).Further experiments demonstrate that both\nword-level (G2Ssta w/ DAN-word only) and hidden-level (G2Ssta w/ DAN-hidden only) answer'
<EOS>
b'alignments in DAN are helpful.We can see the advantages of Graph2Seq learning over Seq2Seq learning on this task by comparing\nthe performance between G2Ssta and Seq2Seq.Compared to Seq2Seq based QG methods that com-\npletely ignore hidden structure information in the passage, our Graph2Seq based method is aware of\nmore hidden structure information such as semantic similarity between any pair of words that are not\ndirectly connected or syntactic relationships between two words captured in a dependency parsing\ntree.'
<EOS>
b'In our experiments, we also observe that doing both forward and backward message passing\nin the GNN encoder is bene\xef\xac\x81cial.Surprisingly, using GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2016) as the graph en-\ncoder (and converting the input graph to an undirected graph) does not provide good performance.In addition, \xef\xac\x81ne-tuning the model using REINFORCE can further improve the model performance\nin all settings'

<EOS>
b'Early works (Mostow & Chen, 2009; Heilman & Smith, 2010; Heilman, 2011) for QG focused on\nrule-based approaches that rely on heuristic rules or hand-crafted templates, with low generaliz-\nability and scalability.Recent attempts have focused on NN-based approaches that do not require\n\n9Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020\n\nmanually-designed rules and are end-to-end trainable.'
<EOS>
b'Existing NN-based approaches (Du et al.,\n2017;Yao et al.; Zhou et al., 2018) rely on the Seq2Seq model with attention, copy or coverage\nmechanisms.In addition, various ways (Zhou et al., 2017; Song et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2018; Sun\net al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018;'
<EOS>
b'Liu et al., 2019) have been proposed to utilize the target answerso as\nto guide the generation of the question.To address the limitations of cross-entropy based sequence\nlearning, some approaches (Song et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2018b) aim at directly optimizing eval-\nuation metrics using REINFORCE.'
<EOS>
b'However, the existing approaches for QG suffer from several limitations; they (i) ignore the rich\nstructure information hidden in text, (ii) solely rely on cross-entropy loss that leads to issues like\nexposure bias and inconsistency between train/test measurement, and (iii) fail to fully exploit the\nanswer information.To address these limitations, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)based'

b'vances in graph representation learning, a number of works have extended the widely used Seq2Seq\narchitectures (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) to Graph2Seq architectures for machine trans-lation, semantic parsing, and AMR(SQL)-to-text tasks(Bastings et al., 2017; Beck et al., 2018;'
<EOS>
b'Xu\net al., 2018a;b;c; Song et al., 2018b).While the high-quality graph structure is crucial for the per-\nformance of GNN-based approaches, most existing works use syntax-based static graph structures\nwhen applied to textual data.Very recently, researchers have started exploring methods to automat-\nically construct a graph of visual objects (Norcliffe-Brown et al., 2018) or words (Liu et al., 2018;'

b'Chen et al., 2019b) when applying GNNs to non-graph structured data.To the best of our knowledge, we are the \xef\xac\x81rst to investigate systematically the performance difference\nbetween syntactic-aware static graph construction and semantics-aware dynamic graph construction\nin the context of question generation.5 CONCLUSION'

b'A DETAILS ON THE RNN DECODERAt each decoding step t, an attention mechanism learns to attend to the most relevant words in the\ninput sequence, and computes a context vectorh\xcb\x9a\nt based on the current decoding state st, the current\ncoverage vector ct and the attention memory.'
<EOS>
b'In addition, the generation probability pgen P r0, 1s is\ncalculated from the context vectorh\xcb\x9a\nt , the decoder state st and the decoderinput yt\xc2\xb41.'
<EOS>
b'Next, pgen is\nused as a soft switch to choose between generating a word from the vocabulary, or copying a word\nfrom the input sequence.We dynamically maintain an extended vocabulary which is the union of the\nusual vocabulary and all words appearing in a batch of source examples (i.e., passages and answers).Finally, in order to encourage the decoder to utilize the diverse components of the input sequence, a\ncoverage mechanism is applied.'
<EOS>
b'At each step, we maintain a coverage vector ct, which is the sum\nof attention distributions over all previous decoder time steps.A coverage loss is also computed to\npenalize repeatedly attending to the same locations of the input sequence.B MODEL SETTINGS'

b'We set the hidden state size of BiLSTM to 150 so that the concatenated\nstate size for both directions is 300.The size of all other hidden layers is set to 300.We apply\na variational dropout (Kingma et al., 2015) rate of 0.4 after word embedding layers and 0.3 after\nRNN layers.'
<EOS>
b'We set the neighborhood size to 10 for dynamic graph construction.The number of\nGNN hops is set to 3.During training, in each epoch, we set the initial teacher forcing probability\nto 0.75 and exponentially increase it to 0.75 \xcb\x9a 0.9999i where i is the training step.'
<EOS>
b'We set \xce\xb1 in the\nreward function to 0.1, \xce\xb3 in the mixed loss function to 0.99, and the coverage loss ratio \xce\xbb to 0.4.We use Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) as the optimizer, and the learning rate is set to 0.001 in the\npretraining stage and 0.00001in the \xef\xac\x81ne-tuning stage.'

b'(Zhou et al., 2018) proposed an extension to the copy mechanism which learns to copy\nnot only single words but also sequences from the input sentence.NQG++ (Zhou et al., 2017) proposed an attention-based Seq2Seq model equipped with a copy\nmechanism and a feature-rich encoder to encode answer position, POS and NER tag information.MPQG+R (Song et al., 2017) proposed an RL-based Seq2Seq model with a multi-perspective\nmatching encoder to incorporate answer information.'
<EOS>
b'Copy and coverage mechanisms are applied.AFPQA (Sun et al., 2018) consists of an answer-focused component which generates an interroga-\ntive word matching the answer type, and a position-aware component which is aware of the position\nof the context words when generating a question by modeling the relative distance between the\ncontext words and the answer.s2sa-at-mp-gsa'
