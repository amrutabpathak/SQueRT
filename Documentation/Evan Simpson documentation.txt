Implemented: The concept for the project was my idea initially, and I contributed to the conceptual design of it as well - came up with the two stage idea, in which we find related snippets first and then perform question answering from there, to save computing time. My main task was organization for the program. For this, I created main, which calls other parts of program in a modular format - previously there had been a lot of standalone files that were not integrated. Did most work on getting the files to work together and integrate; there were a lot of dependency issues and conflicts, especially as the overall program got larger. There were also a number of bugfixes related to cross-platform compatibility; things one person pushed would not necessarily run on other peoples' computers, which I handled and ensured could run. To support this task, I compiled our requirements.txt, the current iteration of which should list every app and library we need to be able to run the program on any platform. 

I also tested the models for stage 1 - we tested four models, distilbert, roberta, bert, and use. I was the one with best access to gpu computing, so it made the most sense for me to test them. I coordinated the group to submit scores for the models over some test files and test questions that I thought would be most relevant. Upon looking at the results, it seemed to me that all the models performed well; we finally settled on distilbert, as one model seemed like it would still give great performance while minimizing computational time. I then began testing our program end to end; as of the time of writing this task is still not finished but a lot of progress has been made, and it should be completed within a few days.
