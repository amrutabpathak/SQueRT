To bridge the connection between two nodes  we formally define a structure relation by encapsulating node attributes  between-node paths  and local topological structures together  which can make the inference conveniently deduced from one node to another node.For learning the inference process  we further introduce meta-optimization on structure relations from training nodes to validation nodes  such that the learnt graph inference capability can be better self-adapted to testing nodes.Comprehensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (including Cora  Citeseer  Pubmed  and NELL) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed GIL when compared against state-of-the-art methods on the semi-supervised node classification task.

 1  INTRODUCTION  Graph  which comprises a set of vertices/nodes together with connected edges  is a formal structural representation of non-regular data.Due to the strong representation ability  it accommodates many potential applications  e.g.  social network (Orsini et al  2017)  world wide data (Page et al  1999)  knowledge graph (Xu et al  2017)  and protein-interaction network (Borgwardt et al  2007).Among these  semi-supervised node classification on graphs is one of the most interesting also popular topics.

Given a graph in which some nodes are labeled  the aim of semi-supervised classification is to infer the categories of those remaining unlabeled nodes by using various priors of the graph. While there have been numerous previous works (Brandes et al  2008; Zhou et al  2004; Zhu et al  2003; Yang et al  2016; Zhao et al  2019) devoted to semi-supervised node classification based on explicit graph Laplacian regularizations  it is hard to efficiently boost the performance of label prediction due to the strict assumption that connected nodes are likely to share the same label information.With the progress of deep learning on grid-shaped images/videos (He et al  2016)  a few of graph convolutional neural networks (CNN) based methods  including spectral (Kipf & Welling  2017) and spatial methods (Niepert et al  2016; Pan et al  2018; Yu et al  2018)  have been proposed to learn local convolution filters on graphs in order to extract more discriminative node representations.

Although graph CNN based methods have achieved considerable capabilities of graph embedding by optimizing filters  they are limited into a conventionally semi-supervised framework and lack of an efficient inference mechanism on graphs.Especially  in the case of few-shot learning  where a small number of training nodes are labeled  this kind of methods would drastically compromise the performance.For example  the Pubmed graph dataset (Sen et al  2008) consists  ∗Corresponding author: Zhen Cui.

These aforementioned works usually boil down to a general classification task  where the model is learnt on a training set and selected by checking a validation set.However  they do not put great efforts on how to learn to infer from one node to another node on a topological graph  especially in the few-shot regime. In this paper  we propose a graph inference learning (GIL) framework to teach the model itself to adaptively infer from reference labeled nodes to those query unlabeled nodes  and finally boost the performance of semi-supervised node classification in the case of a few number of labeled samples.

Given an input graph  GIL attempts to infer the unlabeled nodes from those observed nodes by building between-node relations.The between-node relations are structured as the integration of node attributes  connection paths  and graph topological structures.It means that the similarity between two nodes is decided from three aspects: the consistency of node attributes  the consistency of local topological structures  and the between-node path reachability  as shown in Fig 1.

The local structures anchored around each node as well as the attributes of nodes therein are jointly encoded with graph convolution (Defferrard et al  2016) for the sake of high-level feature extraction.For the between-node path reachability  we adopt the random walk algorithm to obtain the characteristics from a labeled reference node vi to a query unlabeled node vj in a given graph.Based on the computed node representation and between-node reachability  the structure relations can be obtained by computing the similar scores/relationships from reference nodes to unlabeled nodes in a graph.

Inspired by the recent meta-learning strategy (Finn et al  2017)  we learn to infer the structure relations from a training set to a validation set  which can benefit the generalization capability of the learned model.In other words  our proposed GIL attempts to learn some transferable knowledge underlying in the structure relations from training samples to validation samples  such that the learned structure relations can be better self-adapted to the new testing stage. We summarize the main contributions of this work as three folds:  • We propose a novel graph inference learning framework by building structure relations to infer unknown node labels from those labeled nodes in an end-to-end way.

Specifically  spectral filtering methods (Henaff et al  2015; Kipf & Welling  2017) develop convolution-like operators in the spectral domain  and then perform a series of spectral filters by decomposing the graph Laplacian.Unfortunately  the spectral-based approaches often lead to a high computational complex due to the operation of eigenvalue decomposition  especially for a large number of graph nodes.To alleviate this computation burden  local spectral filtering methods (Defferrard et al  2016) are then proposed by parameterizing the frequency responses as a Chebyshev polynomial approximation.

Another type of graph CNNs  namely spatial methods (Li et al  2016; Niepert et al  2016)  can perform the filtering operation by defining the spatial structures of adjacent vertices.Various approaches can be employed to aggregate or sort neighboring vertices  such as diffusion CNNs (Atwood & Towsley  2016)  GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al  2017)  PSCN (Niepert et al  2016)  and NgramCNN (Luo et al  2017).From the perspective of data distribution  recently  the Gaussian induced convolution model (Jiang et al  2019) is proposed to disentangle the aggregation process through encoding adjacent regions with Gaussian mixture model.

 Semi-supervised node classification: Among various graph-related applications  semi-supervised node classification has gained increasing attention recently  and various approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem  including explicit graph Laplacian regularization and graph- embedding approaches.Several classic algorithms with graph Laplacian regularization contain the label propagation method using Gaussian random fields (Zhu et al  2003)  the regularization framework by relying on the local/global consistency (Zhou et al  2004)  and the random walk- based sampling algorithm for acquiring the context information (Yang et al  2016).To further address scalable semi-supervised learning issues (Liu et al  2012)  the Anchor Graph regularization approach (Liu et al  2010) is proposed to scale linearly with the number of graph nodes and then applied to massive-scale graph datasets.

By jointly considering the local- and global-consistency information  dual graph convolutional networks (Zhuang & Ma  2018) are presented to deal with semi-supervised node classification.The critical difference between our proposed GIL and those previous semi-supervised node classification methods is to adopt a graph inference strategy by defining structure relations on graphs and then leverage a meta optimization mechanism to learn an inference model  which could be the first time to the best of our knowledge  while the existing graph CNNs take semi-supervised node classification as a general classification task. 3 THE PROPOSED MODEL 3.1 PROBLEM DEFINITION  Formally  we denote an undirected/directed graph as G = {V  E  X   Y}  where V = {vi}n i=1 is the finite set of n (or |V|) vertices  E ∈ Rn×n defines the adjacency relationships (i.e.  edges) between vertices representing the topology of G  X ∈ Rn×d records the explicit/implicit attributes/signals of vertices  and Y ∈ Rn is the vertex labels of C classes.

A sophisticated machine learning technique used in most existing methods (Kipf & Welling  2017; Zhou et al  2004) is to choose the optimal classifier (trained on a training set) after checking the performance on the validation set.However  these methods essentially ignore how to extract transferable knowledge from these known labeled nodes to unlabeled nodes  as the graph structure itself implies node connectivity/reachability.Moreover  due to the scarcity of labeled samples  the performance of such a classifier is usually not satisfying.

 3.2 STRUCTURE RELATION For convenient inference  we specifically build a structure relation between two nodes on the topology graph.The labeled vertices (in a training set) are viewed as the reference nodes  and their information can be propagated into those unlabeled vertices for improving the label prediction accuracy.Formally  given a reference node vi ∈ VLabel  we define the score of a query node vj similar to vi as  (1) where Gvi and Gvj may be understood as the centralized subgraphs around vi and vj  respectively. fe  fr  fP are three abstract functions that we explain as follows:  si→j = fr(fe(Gvi )  fe(Gvj )  fP (vi  vj  E))   • Node representation fe(Gvi) −→ Rdv   encodes the local representation of the centralized subgraph Gvi around node vi  and may thus be understood as a local filter function on graphs.

The spectral graph convo- lution can be defined as the multiplication of signal X with a filter gθ(Λ) = diag(θ) parameterized by θ in the Fourier domain: conv(X ) = gθ(L) ∗ X = Ugθ(Λ)UT X   where parameter θ ∈ Rn is a vector of Fourier coefficients.To reduce the computational complexity and obtain the local information  we use an approximate local filter of the Chebyshev polynomial (Defferrard et al  2016)  gθ(Λ) = (cid:80)K−1 k=0 θkTk(ˆΛ)  where parameter θ ∈ RK is a vector of Chebyshev coefficients and Tk(ˆΛ) ∈ Rn×n is the Chebyshev polynomial of order k evaluated at ˆΛ = 2Λ/λmax − In  a diagonal matrix of scaled eigenvalues.The graph filtering operation can then be expressed as gθ(Λ) ∗ X = (cid:80)K−1 k=0 θkTk(ˆL)X   where Tk(ˆL) ∈ Rn×n is the Chebyshev polynomial of order k evaluated at the scaled Laplacian ˆL = 2L/λmax − In. Further  we can construct multi-scale receptive fields for each vertex based on the Laplacian matrix L  where each receptive field records hopping neighborhood relationships around the reference vertex vi  and forms a local centralized subgraph.

 The sequence of nodes from vertex i to vertex j is a random walk on the graph  which can be modeled as a classical Markov chain by considering the set of graph vertices.To represent this formulation  we show that P t ij is the probability of getting from vertex vi to vertex vj in t steps.This fact is easily exhibited by considering a t-step path from vertex vi to vertex vj as first taking a single step to some vertex h  and then taking t − 1 steps to vj.

Our proposed GIL can significantly outperform these graph Laplacian regularized methods on four graph datasets  including Deep walk (Zhou et al  2004)  modularity clustering (Brandes et al  2008)  Gaussian fields (Zhu et al  2003)  and graph embedding (Yang et al  2016) methods.For example  we can achieve much higher performance than the deepwalk method (Zhou et al  2004)  e.g.  43.2% vs 74.1% on the Citeseer dataset  65.3% vs 83.1% on the Pubmed dataset  and 58.1% vs 78.9% on the NELL dataset.We find that the graph embedding method (Yang et al  2016)  which has considered both label information and graph structure during sampling  can obtain lower accuracies than our proposed GIL by 9.4% on the Citeseer dataset and 10.5% on the Cora dataset  respectively.

When using structure relations  “GIL /w learning on Vtr" obtains an improvement of 1.9% (over “GCN /w learning on Vtr”)  which can be attributed to the building connection between nodes.The meta-optimization strategy (“GIL /w meta-training from Vtr → Vval" vs “GIL /w learning on Vtr”) has a gain of 2.9%  which indicates that a good inference capability can be learnt through meta-optimization.It is worth noting that  GIL adopts a meta-optimization strategy to learn the inference model  which is a process of migrating  7  Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020  from a training set to a validation set.

Furthermore  we report the classification results of our proposed GIL by using mean and max-pooling mechanisms  respectively.GIL with mean pooling (i.e.  “GIL /w 2 conv layers + mean pooling") can get a better result than the GIL method with max-pooling (i.e.  “GIL /w 2 conv layers + max-pooling")  e.g.  86.2% vs 85.2% on the Cora graph dataset.The reason may be that the graph network with two convolutional layers and the mean pooling mechanism can obtain the optimal graph embeddings  but when increasing the network layers  more parameters of a certain graph model need to be optimized  which may lead to the over-fitting issue.

 Inﬂuence of different between-node steps: We compare the classification performance within different between-node steps for our proposed GIL and GCN (Kipf & Welling  2017)  as illustrated in Fig 2(a).The length of between-node steps can be computed with the shortest path between reference nodes and query nodes.When the step between nodes is smaller  both GIL and GCN methods can predict the category information for a small part of unlabeled nodes in the testing set.

The reason may be that the node category information may be disturbed by its nearest neighboring nodes with different labels and fewer nodes are within 1 or 2 steps in the testing set.The GIL and GCN methods can infer the category information for a part of unlabeled nodes by adopting node attributes  when two nodes are not connected in the graph (i.e.  step=∞).By increasing the length of reachability path  the inference process of the GIL method would become difficult and more graph structure information may be employed in the predicted process.

 Computational complexity: For the computational complexity of our proposed GIL  the cost is mainly spent on the computations of node representation  between-node reachability  and class-to- node relationship  which are about O((ntr + nte) ∗ e ∗ din ∗ dout)  O((ntr + nte) ∗ e ∗ P )  and O(ntr ∗ nted2 out)  respectively. ntr and nte refer to the numbers of training and testing nodes  din and dout denote the input and output dimensions of node representation  e is about the average degree of graph node  and P is the step length of node reachability.Compared with those classic Graph CNNs (Kipf & Welling  2017)  our proposed GIL has a slightly higher cost due to an extra inference learning process  but can complete the testing stage with several seconds on these benchmark datasets. 6 CONCLUSION  In this work  we tackled the semi-supervised node classification task with a graph inference learning method  which can better predict the categories of these unlabeled nodes in an end-to-end framework.
