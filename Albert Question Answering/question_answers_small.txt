Inspired by the recent meta-learning strategy (Finn et al  2017)  we learn to infer the structure relations from a training set to a validation set  which can benefit the generalization capability of the learned model.

We pre-train our proposed GIL model for 200 iterations with the training set  where its initial learning rate  decay factor  and momentum are set to 0.05  0.95  and 0.9  respectively.

We summarize the main contributions of this work as three folds:  • We propose a novel graph inference learning framework by building structure relations to infer unknown node labels from those labeled nodes in an end-to-end way.

By increasing the length of reachability path  the inference process of the GIL method would become difficult and more graph structure information may be employed in the predicted process.
